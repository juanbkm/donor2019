            <h3>Who cofinanced with us the most?</h3>
            <p>Compared to 2018, commitments from bilateral financing partners in 2019 jumped by 25%, totaling $3.67 billion. In contrast, counting of commitments from multilateral financing partners was affected by the new and stricter definition of cofinancing. Some $1.97 billion from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for three projects were not included in 2019’s report of commitments, bringing down the 2019 commitment to $905 million, down by 71% from 2018’s total.</p>
