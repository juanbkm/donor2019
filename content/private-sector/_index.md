section_summary: "ADB sees partnerships with the private sector as crucial to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific region by 2030 (Strategy 2030). It recognizes that the private sector is the largest contributor to economic development in the region. Under Strategy 2030, ADB has strengthened partnerships with the private sector and increasingly mainstreamed into each Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) comprehensive market assessments and inputs relevant to private sector development and private sector operations. By 2024, ADB envisions that its private sector operations will reach one-third of its operations in number."
