summary: "A technical assistance (TA) is underway to modernize Central Asia's energy coordinating dispatch center (CDC), Energiya. A modernized CDC will help increase regional energy trading and addresses frequent power outages and the increasing use of fossil fuels. The TA is cofinanced by the Asian Clean Energy Fund, under Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (ACEF-CEFPF), and the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)."

### Background

Power trade among Central Asian countries radically declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Before that, 25,413 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) were traded among the Central Asian Power Systems (CAPS)-Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.?? 

The drop in energy trade has caused widespread power outages in Tajikistan in winters and increased fossil fuel use by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summers. After Tajikistan left the CAPS in 2009, the energy trade had decreased to 2,256 million kWh, and this declined further in 2016 at 2,080 million kWh. 

Power flow between the national electricity grids of the CAPS is regulated by the coordinating dispatch center (CDC), Energiya, which was formerly based in Moscow. It is now located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Since its establishment in the 1960s, no significant technological modernizations were made at CDC, and it operates on outdated, Soviet-era technologies to perform its functions.? 

Examples of how the regional power trade is constrained due to technological limitations of the CDC can be seen in the forecasting of power flows and adjustment to real-time figures, delay in locating grid faults, and mismatched actual metered flows with the CDC's telemetry. All these contribute to the CDC not having a full and accurate picture of the energy flow among the CAPs.?? 

In late 2018, countries under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program requested ADB’s help to increase regional power trade among Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The cluster technical assistance (TA) on [Regional Cooperation on Increasing Cross-Border Energy Trading within the Central Asian Power System](https://www.adb.org/projects/52112-001/main#project-pds) was approved with three subprojects that are strategically linked to the overall project objective.  

### Interventions

The participating countries target coming out of the project with increased cross-border energy trade of at least 11,000 million kilowatt-hours annually. The interventions are split into three subprojects and are designed independently of one another yet contributes to the umbrella cluster TA.  

The first subproject, [Modernization of Coordinating Dispatch Center Energiya](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52112/52112-002-tasp-en.pdf), is cofinanced by the Asian Clean Energy Fund, under Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF), and the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF).?It seeks to modernize the energy coordination dispatch center, Energiya, by introducing an energy data management (EDM) system to replace all Soviet-era equipment at Energiya. The EDM, a high-level technology (HLT), is expected to enable operation of the regional grid in real-time and significantly increase volumes of telemetry information collected by Energiya. This will also allow centralization of the CAPS’ emergency automation.  

The EDM is designed based on state-of-the-art practices of international dispatch centers. Knowledge-sharing workshops among the CAPS are done with insights from Japanese and European experiences in power management and large cross-border energy trade, respectively. 

The second and third subprojects complete the picture of an enhanced energy trade- one component will address bottlenecks to the regional trade and examine the national grids of all CAPS countries to identify and provide solutions to energy flow constraints; the other will expand membership through studies and dialogue facilitating new members into CAPS.

### Results

The ongoing subproject, which targets a modernized Energiya using high-level technology data management by the end of 2021, is on track.  

An assessment of the needs of Energiya, which built on the work of other development partners such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank, has been conducted. The design of the EDM system has also been done and accepted by the CDC. 

As of writing, the modular procurement plan to acquire the EDM is being finalized. The modular approach is used to adapt to budget availability and urgency of need in procurement.
