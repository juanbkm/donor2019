summary: "The last few hundred communes in Viet Nam's mountainous regions finally got electricity in 2020. This, after an ADB project with cofinancing from the Clean Energy Fund, under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, helped the country set up mini hydropower plants that provided hundreds of thousands of households with electricity, and opened economic opportunities to the men and women of these communes."

### Background

Electrification has been one of Viet Nam�s remarkable achievements in the recent decades. The share of households with access to electricity grew from 2.5 % in 1975 to 97 % in 2007. 
In the mountainous north and central Viet Nam, however, some 298 communes remain off-grid. These communes are home to some of Viet Nam's poor indigenous communities. To address this remaining service gap, Viet Nam invested in distribution networks and poorly constructed and unreliable low voltage electrical systems to attain universal access.

The project, Viet Nam�s [Renewable Energy Development and Network Expansion and Rehabilitation for Remote Communes Sector Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-42182-013-pcr), received funding from ADB and the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The result-- 99% of all Vietnamese families have access to electricity by 2020.

The project is consistent with Viet Nam�s Socio-Economic Development Plans and ADB�s country strategy and program for Viet Nam. Both master plans aim to promote inclusive pro-poor economic growth by investing in rural infrastructure to remove development barriers in poorer regions of the country and encourage environmentally sustainable investments.

### Interventions

The project sought to build mini hydropower plants (MHPs) and repair existing networks.  The MHP help reduce grid loss as they are located close to poor and remote parts of the country. Frequent consultations with the municipal government, related ministries, key stakeholders, and communities during several review missions and associated workshops were done to make the project collaborative. 

New mini-hydro power plants developed: The project successfully constructed five MHPs with total capacity of 32.5 megawatts. Along with construction of the MHP, electricity from the national grid was provided to 8,767 households in 36 villages, including to 827 households that gained access to electricity for the first time.  

Rehabilitated and repaired of existing networks: The networks were rehabilitated and eventually reached more than 3000 villages, providing electricity to over 300,000 households in the remote and mountainous provinces. 

New connections and subsidies for poor families: Not only do poor families now have access to electricity, connection to the grid and in-house wiring also come for free. At completion, a total of 142,572 households received subsidized service connections, including wiring inside the house, and a power socket and bulb.

### Results

Household electrification increased from 83.5% at appraisal to 96.8% at project completion. Because of electrification, economic activities increased among the households in the communes. Households consumed about 6 gigawatt-hour of electricity per year for income generating activities. This reduced the poverty rate in the project districts by 50% in 2017.

The cost of electricity was also affordable for commune households. An evaluation with independent verification found that electricity is affordable for households, as it costs an average of 6.54% share of their household monthly expenditures. 
 
In addition, the project had a strong gender and ethnic minority components to it.  The project integrated gender mainstreaming activities in the project�s ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), which were, among others, increase gender mainstreaming capacity of the power companies, increase participation of women in campaigns on raising awareness of safe electricity use, ensuring free electricity connections for poor, women-headed households, and increasing women�s representation in planning, implementing, and monitoring project activities. The project's outcomes provided both strategic and practical benefits to poor people, particularly women and ethnic groups. Specifically, it improved new electricity connections to 300,034 households, including a free service connection to 12,672 woman-headed households.
