### Background

The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2014 to 2016 revealed Viet Nam’s vulnerability to climate change, particularly affecting the country’s south-central coastal and central highlands regions. Rainfall was 40% to 70% below average in 2015 but the following year, historical floods ensued.  Many farmers, especially those relying on rain-fed irrigation systems, suffered significant income loss. Their harvests were reduced [substantially](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/49404/49404-002-rrp-en.pdf), as about 400,000 hectares of crop lands were affected.

This experience prompted many farmers to turn to on-farm micro-irrigation practices such as drip or sprinkler systems. This means less cost for farmers because these systems need less manpower and electricity for pumping water.  The El Nino has also forced many farmers to replace their old crops with high value crops (HVC), such as coffee, peppers, grapes, apples, dragon fruits, and mangoes. These crops can withstand longer dry spells and are more suitable to areas with varying climates.

However, their choice of crops and irrigation system were mismatched. The micro irrigation system was mostly designed for rice, which needs flood irrigation. This cannot be applied to HVCs because they need water less frequently and in volumes optimal for their growth, far less then what rice demands. Convenience and access controls could also be a problem when it comes to micro-irrigation systems; they lack the flexibility to provide the needed amount of water on demand.

### Interventions

This mismatch was addressed by the Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project. Initiated by ADB through the collaboration of the Climate Change Fund and the government of the Netherlands Trust Fund, this project will introduce an innovative solution: pressurized piped irrigation with remote sensing technology.  

The pressurized piped irrigation system functions like domestic water supply systems. It provides water on demand through a system of hydrants and control valves. These give farmers greater flexibility to control the amount and duration of irrigation while simultaneously allowing operators to control and measure water use more effectively and to apply the correct water charges. Piped systems are also more resilient to extreme weather conditions and need less maintenance, thus making them more cost-effective.  

Remote sensing technology modernizes this system further by providing farmers with real-time information on water productivity. Equipped with this technology, farmers can know the degree of their efficient use of the available water resources for their growing crops and can improve their on-farm irrigation scheduling with improved water productivity.  

Viet Nam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) provides overall supervision and guidance in the implementation of the project at the national level through its Central Project Office. Five provincial committees in the five project sites take charge of activities in their own areas. To complement the  modernization of the irrigation facilities, the project will provide farmers with training in on-farm water management to cope with climate variability. They will also be given technical advisory services to help them identify and develop the appropriate micro-irrigation systems that meet their [needs](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/49404/49404-002-pam-en.pdf).

### Results

The preparation of this project has already meaningfully brought development partners together. The component of the project preparatory technical assistance, funded by The Netherlands Trust Fund, provided an opportunity for stakeholders such as the Australian Water Partnership, UK Meteorological Office, IHE Delft, and the International Food Policy Research Institute to share and exchange knowledge. They shared technical designs that can provide farmers with a better level of service, assessed vulnerability to climate change, measured water productivity, and looked at the links between water and energy.  These knowledge exchanges enriched the project design and helped meet the level of service needed by farmers while incorporating climate [resiliency](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/49404/49404-002-pam-en.pdf).  

Though still ongoing, the project also complements initiatives by other development partners. A Green Climate Fund grant to be administered by the United Nations Development Programme will provide vulnerable smallholder farmers in the project area with improved access to water and capacity to adopt on-farm water management practices. A parallel technical support from the Government of Australia through the Australian Water Partnership will help improve water resource planning and management. These initiatives were developed in coordination with ADB and share the project’s expected outcomes.

Eight modern irrigation systems are now being set up in the provinces of  Binh Thuan, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa, and Ninh Thuan in Viet Nam.  Once fully established, they will directly benefit about 40,000 households, including 7,000 ethnic minority[households](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/49404/49404-002-pam-en.pdf). They are tailored to the needs of Viet Nam’s farmers, and a strategic fit to the country’s overall goal for the agriculture sector: sustained growth, improved efficiency, and competitiveness. They also support Viet Nam’s national climate change strategy that aims to ensure food and water security.  

The project is not just modernizing irrigation in Viet Nam, it is also empowering farmers to protect their crops against extreme weather changes. The facilities give them sufficient control over their irrigation supply and make them active stakeholders in protecting natural resources severely threatened by climate change.
