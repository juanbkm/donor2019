summary: "A pressurized piped irrigation system equipped with remote sensing technology promises to change the way farming is done in five provinces in Viet Nam. Supported by the Climate Change Fund and Netherlands Trust Fund, the irrigation systems will climate-proof farmlands and directly benefit about 39,140 households, including 7,050 ethnic minority households."

### Background

The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2014 to 2016 revealed Viet Nam’s vulnerability to climate change, particularly affecting the country’s south-central coastal and central highlands regions. Rainfall was 40% to 70% below average in 2015 but the following year, historical floods ensued.  Many farmers, especially those relying on rain-fed irrigation systems, suffered significant income loss. Their harvests were reduced substantially, as about 400,000 hectares of crop lands were affected.

This experience prompted many farmers to turn to on-farm micro-irrigation practices such as drip or sprinkler systems. This means less cost for farmers because these systems need less manpower and electricity for pumping water.  The El Nino has also forced many farmers to replace their old crops with high value crops (HVC), such as coffee, peppers, grapes, apples, dragon fruits, and mangoes. These crops can withstand longer dry spells and are more suitable to areas with varying climates.

However, their choice of crops and irrigation system were mismatched. The micro irrigation system was mostly designed for rice, which needs flood irrigation. This cannot be applied to HVCs because they need water less frequently and in volumes optimal for their growth, far less then what rice demands. Convenience and access controls could also be a problem when it comes to micro-irrigation systems; they lack the flexibility to provide the needed amount of water on demand.
