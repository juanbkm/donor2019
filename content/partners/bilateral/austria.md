<a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/austria-fact-sheet" target="_blank">Austria</a>’s development assistance is felt through its support for the energy and water sectors and knowledge exchange via provision of experts as secondees with ADB. In October 2018, Austria’s focus expanded with the signing of an Instrument of Contribution for €2 million to the Cities Development Initiative for Asia Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnerships Facility. Austria is the first contributor to the Fund.

<a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/austria-fact-sheet" target="_blank">Austria</a> also contributes to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. Austria’s Federal Ministry of Finance, along with the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs, Austrian Development Agency, and the Development Bank of Austria, work with ADB on agriculture, education, energy, food security, human rights, migration, peace and human security, private and financial sector development, urban development, and water.
