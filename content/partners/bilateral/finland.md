<a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/finland-fact-sheet" target="_blank">Finland</a> provides development assistance for environment and natural resource conservation, peace processes, crisis and disasters, and regional cooperation, particularly in Central Asia and the Greater Mekong Subregion. Nepal and Viet Nam are long-term partners, while Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic have benefitted as well. Finland supports the peace process in Myanmar and has also contributed to the Typhoon Yolanda Multi-donor Trust Fund.

Cooperation with ADB in the past has included grant support for a rural poverty reduction project in Cambodia and education sector reform in Nepal. Finland supported the Core Environment Program in the Greater Mekong Subregion and will participate in ADB’s Sponsor-Funded Staff Program by funding two specialists in the social and private sectors, respectively.
