The United Arab Emirates puts primary importance on education, energy, finance and trade, health and food security, regional initiatives, transport, and the urban services. Development assistance is channeled through the <a href="https://www.adfd.ae/english/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Abu Dhabi Fund for Development</a>, established in 1971 by the Abu Dhabi government. The fund provides concessionary loans for economic and social development projects.

In 2012, ADB and Abu Dhabi Fund signed an MOU on cofinancing arrangements 2012–2015. This has since been extended to cover 2015–2020.
