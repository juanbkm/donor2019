The United Arab Emirates prioritizes education, energy, finance and trade, health and food security, regional initiatives, transport, and the urban services. Development assistance is channeled through the [Abu Dhabi Fund for Development](https://www.adfd.ae/english/Pages/Home.aspx), established in 1971 by the Abu Dhabi government. The fund provides concessionary loans for economic and social development projects. 

In 2012, ADB and Abu Dhabi Fund signed a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.adfd.ae/Lists/Publications%20Image%20Library/English%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf) on cofinancing arrangements 2012–2015. This has since been extended to cover 2015–2020.
