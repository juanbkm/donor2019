[Spain](https://www.adb.org/publications/spain-fact-sheet) provides development support primarily for gender equality, cultural diversity, indigenous people, and environmental sustainability. Spain’s assistance extends mainly to Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, and focuses on infrastructure development, energy, and water. In 2018, ADB signed its first memorandum of understanding with the [Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation](http://www.aecid.es/EN/aecid), where the two sides agreed to pursue knowledge sharing and collaborative work in a wide range of areas, including but not limited to water and sanitation, agro-industry and rural development, renewable energy, and climate change.

Several departments coordinated through the Ministry of Cooperation and External Affairs manage development cooperation, whereas the Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness is responsible for the relationship with ADB and other MDBs. Apart from the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance, Spain contributes to the Clean Energy Fund and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility.
