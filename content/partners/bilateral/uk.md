The [United Kingdom]("https://www.adb.org/publications/united-kingdom-fact-sheet")’s (UK)</a> development assistance aims to promote sustainable development and eliminate world poverty. Through the [Department of International Development](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development) (DFID), UK has been supporting projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,selected states in India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. DFID has different priority themes for each of these countries, but generally, its projects prioritize job creation, gender, health care, education, private sector and trade, and governance. At the regional level, DFID also supports trade and connectivity programs in Central West and South Asia. Other UK agencies involved in international coordination and the provision of development assistance include the (i) [Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy), (ii) the [Foreign Commonwealth Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office), (iii) the [Conflict, Stability and Security Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/conflict-stability-and-security-fund), (iv) [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs), (v) [the BBC World Service](https://www.bbc.com/), (vi) [HM Revenue and Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/about/our-governance), (vii) [Prosperity Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cross-government-prosperity-fund-programme) and (viii) [the Scottish Government](https://www.gov.scot/).   

ADB and UK sought ways to deepen their collaboration in Asia and the Pacific during a high-level consultation in January 2019 and ADB President Nakao’s visit to the UK in September 2019. The topics they discussed included gender, climate change, differentiated pricing, and areas of mutual interest such as integrity (including safeguards and supply chains, gender, sexual harassment, procurement and fraud reporting), gender, climate change, disability and fragile, conflict affected situations.

Through the Supply Chain Finance Program (SCFP) and the [Trade Finance Program](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/trade-supply-chain-finance-program/main) (TFP), UK was also able to engage with ADB"s private sector operations. SCFP works with a bank domiciled in the United Kingdom and has provided guarantees supporting about $660.55 million in trade in over 828 transactions as of October 2019. The TFP has mobilized $309.28 million in cofinancing with the same bank domiciled in the United Kingdom. This cofinancing helps leverage ADB resources and brings more support for DMCs as well as exports, imports, growth and job creation.
