The <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/united-kingdom-fact-sheet" target="_blank">United Kingdom’s (UK)</a> development assistance aims to promote sustainable development and eliminate world poverty. Through the [Department of International Development](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development) (DFID), UK has been supporting projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, selected states in India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. DFID has different priority themes for each of these countries, but generally, its projects prioritize job creation, gender, health care, education, private sector and trade, and governance. At the regional level, DFID also supports trade and connectivity programs in Central West and South Asia.  

ADB and UK sought ways to deepen their collaboration in Asia and the Pacific during a high-level consultation in January 2019 and ADB President Nakao’s visit to the UK in September 2019. The topics they discussed included gender, climate change, differentiated pricing, and areas of mutual interest such as integrity (including safeguards and supply chains, gender, sexual harassment, procurement and fraud reporting), gender, climate change, disability and fragile, conflict affected situations.
