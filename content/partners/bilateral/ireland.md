The Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States, established in April 2019, is the first single-donor trust fund financed by Ireland. The country committed €12 million (US$13 million) to support small island developing states in their ability to respond to climate change and disaster resilience challenges. The fund was officially launched at the ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji in May 2019.   

<a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/ireland-fact-sheet" target="_blank">Ireland</a>’s priorities for international development are outlined in its current development policy “One World One Future” from 2013. It focuses on three goals: (i) reduced hunger, stronger resilience; (ii) sustainable development, inclusive economic growth; and (iii) better governance, human rights and accountability. Priority countries are Timor-Leste, Viet Nam, and small island developing states.
