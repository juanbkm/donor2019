The [Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States](./modalities/trust-funds/single-partner-trust-funds/#itfbccdrsids), established in April 2019, is the first single-donor trust fund financed by Ireland. The country committed €12 million ($13.5 million) to support small island developing states in responding to climate change and disaster resilience challenges. The fund was officially launched at the ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji in May 2019.

[Ireland](https://www.adb.org/publications/ireland-fact-sheet)’s priorities for international development are outlined in its current development policy, “A Better World,” which was launched in February 2019. It focuses on reaching those furthest behind and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly on (i) prioritizing gender equality; (ii) reducing humanitarian need; (iii) climate action; and (iv) strengthening governance. In addition, Ireland aims to channel its energies to interventions focusing on protection, food, and people. Through its development agencies [Department of Finance](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-finance/), [Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.dfa.ie/), and the [Irish Aid](https://www.irishaid.ie/), Ireland prioritizes Timor-Leste, Viet Nam, and small island developing states.

ADB's [Trade Finance Program](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/trade-supply-chain-finance-program/main) (TFP) supported 17 Irish export and import transactions (through Irish and non-Irish banks) to developing Asia valued at over $61.34 million as of October 2019. Exports and imports were to 4 countries, but mostly to Armenia, Bangladesh, and Georgia. Isolating TFP’s work with Irish banks, TFP works with one bank operating in Ireland.
