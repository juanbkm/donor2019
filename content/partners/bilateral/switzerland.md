Cooperation with Switzerland covered both project-specific cofinancing and trust funds. In 2018, Switzerland joined Austria as new donors to the Cities Development Initiative for Asia Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility.

SECO’s priority countries in Asia are Indonesia and Viet Nam; while SDC’s priority countries in Asia are in the Mekong subregion (Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar), Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, and Pakistan. Both SECO and SDC are active in Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
