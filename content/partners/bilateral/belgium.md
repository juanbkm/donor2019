[Belgium](https://www.adb.org/publications/belgium-fact-sheet)’s priorities are humanitarian aid, agriculture and food security, infrastructure, innovative financing, social development, education, health, climate change, biodiversity, gender equality, and migration. Belgium has cofinanced investment projects in Azerbaijan, Cambodia, India, and Sri Lanka. 

[International and European Financial Affairs, Belgian Federal Treasury](https://finance.belgium.be/en/IEFA), is Belgium’s contact point with the international financial institutions. The [Directorate-General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid integrated into the Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation](https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/policy/development_cooperation/who_we_are/our_organisation/dgd) (DGD) is responsible for drafting development policies, allocating Belgium’s official development assistance, planning and monitoring governmental cooperation programs. DGD partners with the [Belgian Technical Cooperation](https://www.enabel.be/) as the implementing agency that carries out study and training grants as well as assignments on sustainable development on both national and international level. 

ADB's [Trade Finance Program](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/trade-supply-chain-finance-program/main) (TFP) supported 226 Belgian export and import transactions (through Belgian and non- Belgian banks) to developing Asia valued at over $89.47 million as of October 2019. Exports and imports were to 8 countries, but mostly to Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. Isolating TFP’s work with Belgian banks, TFP has worked with one bank domiciled in Belgium and has provided guarantees supporting $153.84 million in trade in over 266 transactions. The TFP has mobilized $42.99 million in cofinancing with banks domiciled in Belgium. This cofinancing helps leverage ADB resources and brings more support for developing members as well as exports, imports, growth, and job creation.
