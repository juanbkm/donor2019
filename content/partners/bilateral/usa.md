The <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/united-states-fact-sheet" target="_blank">United States</a> (US)’ contribution to development in Asia covers various sectors and themes. It contributes to ADB through the Cities Development Initiative for Asia and the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund.

<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> is the country’s lead development institution that advances U.S. national security and economic prosperity and promotes a path to recipient self-reliance and resilience. It partners with ADB in the promotion of innovative and alternative energy sources, post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal, and sustainable and resilient urban development in Viet Nam. In 2018, USAID and ADB held a consultation workshop to explore mutual collaboration for the Philippines. USAID also continues to support the Asia Clean Energy Forum up to 2023.

ADB also worked with the U.S. State Department, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, and the Department of the Interior on various development fronts throughout the region. USAID looks forward to closer collaboration with ADB in addressing food security in Myanmar and furthering regional initiatives in the Mekong subregion and Central Asia, consistent with the US State Department and USAID Joint Strategic Plan until 2022.
