Although trade issues have become a major part of its foreign policy agenda in recent years, the [United States of America (USA)](https://www.adb.org/publications/united-states-fact-sheet) has continued to support development in Asia, especially in the sectors of agriculture, democracy and governance, economic growth; environment, education and training, global health, global partnerships, and humanitarian assistance. Its priority themes include broadly shared economic prosperity; democracy and good governance; global health, food security, environmental sustainability and education; prevention and recovery from conflicts; and humanitarian assistance in the wake of natural and man-made disasters. 

The [United States Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/) (USAID) is the country’s lead development institution. It advances U.S. national security and economic prosperity and promotes a path to recipient self-reliance and resilience. In 2019, it merged the offices of US Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace to create the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. It also created three new bureaus: Bureau for Conflict-Prevention and Stabilization, Bureau for Resilience and Food Security, and Bureau for Asia.

Through the [Trade Finance Program](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/trade-supply-chain-finance-program/main) (TFP), the US was able to actively collaborate with ADB’s private sector operations. TFP supported 984 American export and import transactions (through American and non-American banks) to developing Asia valued at over $2.12 billion as of October 2019. Exports and imports were to 12 countries, but mostly to Bangladesh, Pakistan and Viet Nam. Isolating TFP’s work with American banks, TFP works with 10 banks domiciled in United States and has provided guarantees supporting $15.86 billion in trade in over 8,700 transactions. The TFP has mobilized $5.85 billion in cofinancing with banks domiciled in United States. This cofinancing helps leverage ADB resources and brings more support for DMCs.

The program also signed a risk participation agreement with Citibank NA for $50 million in October 2016 that targets to cover all ADB developing countries. Currently, Citibank NA has included India, being one of its key market under the program. As of August 2019, ADB has supported under the agreement with Citibank NA new loans amounting to US$96.04 million, of which US$48.02 million is ADB’s share.
