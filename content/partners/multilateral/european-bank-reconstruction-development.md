The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is a development bank that provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and existing companies. It prioritizes support for countries in Central and West Asia, and North Africa. It focuses on advancing developmental goals in finance and policy reform.  

Over the last three years, ADB and EBRD have negotiated a Procurement Framework Arrangement and undertaken their first sovereign project specific cofinancing.
