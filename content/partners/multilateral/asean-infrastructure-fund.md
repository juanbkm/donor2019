The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund is a dedicated fund established by the ASEAN member nations and ADB to address the ASEAN region's infrastructure development needs by mobilizing regional savings, including foreign exchange reserves. The fund prioritizes ASEAN member countries and provides loans to finance infrastructure investment projects in the transport, energy, water and sanitation, environment and rural development, and social infrastructure sectors. 

In 2018, two new facilities were created within the fund on a three-year pilot basis: Inclusive Finance Facility (IFF) and ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility (AGCF). IFF offers limited concessional loans to members that fall within ADB’s Group A classification while the ACGF aims to leverage the fund’s existing resources to bridge the viability gap for green infrastructure projects and attract private capital into these projects.
