Officially launched in May 2008, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/neighbourhood/pdf/key-documents/nif/20151022-2014-report-optimised-final.pdf">the Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF) </a> is an innovative financial instrument used as a modality of the EU. Its primary aim is to support key investment infrastructure projects in the transport, energy, social and environment sectors as well as to support private sector development (small and medium sized enterprises) in the neighborhood region. Projects receiving a grant from the NIF must be in a partner country that has signed an action plan with the EU (currently Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia, and Ukraine).
