The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945, and currently made up of 193-member states. It was established to take action on current issues on peace and security, climate change, sustainable development, human rights, disarmament, terrorism, humanitarian and health emergencies, gender equality, governance, and food production. 

ADB have been collaborating with several UN agencies since 1972, among them the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS; UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme; UN Environment Programme; UN Human Settlements Programme; UN Industrial Development Organization; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; UN Population Fund; World Health Organization; and the World Tourism Organization. 

UNICEF and ADB signed a 5-year agreement to increase access for disadvantaged children, young people, and women in the areas of health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, early childhood development, education, child protection and climate change. In 2018, UNICEF approved a project supporting primary education in Bangladesh, with cofinancing of $0.50 million. The UN organizations have contributed a total of $120 million to its partnership with ADB, through UNICEF, UNDP, UNPF, and WHO.
