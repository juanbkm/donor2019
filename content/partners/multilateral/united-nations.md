The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations (UN)</a> is an international organization founded in 1945, and currently made up of 193-member states. It was established to act on current issues on peace and security, climate change, sustainable development, human rights, disarmament, terrorism, humanitarian and health emergencies, gender equality, governance, and food production. 

ADB have been collaborating with several UN agencies since 1972, among them the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS; UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme; UN Environment Programme; UN Human Settlements Programme; UN Industrial Development Organization; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; UN Population Fund; World Health Organization; and the World Tourism Organization. 

ADB and UNDP have been collaborating extensively at the country level throughout the region. In April 2019, ADB and UNDP signed a memorandum of agreement to renew and deepen their collaboration in supporting progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Asia and the Pacific. The MOU supersedes a 2007 agreement between ADB and UNDP. Also in 2019, UNDP  cofinanced a technical assistance on renewable energy for the Pacific region.
