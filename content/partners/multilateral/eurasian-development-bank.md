The Eurasian Development Bank or (EDB), established in 2006 by Russia and Kazakhstan, is a financial organization that seeks to promote economic growth and integration in Eurasia. Other members of the bank are Armenia, Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, which also are its priority countries to support. 

EDB started working with ADB in 2013 in the areas of agriculture, transport, energy, and public services and, until 2020, is in partnership following a Framework Cofinancing Agreement. EDB and ADB renewed their partnership to deepen the two organization's cooperation and cofinancing opportunities for the next five years amounting to $1 billion. Recently, EDB approved $395 million for four projects.
