The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) is a joint development finance institution of the Nordic countries. It was established in 1989 to provide concessional financing for climate change-related projects in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, usually in collaboration with trusted partners. 

Currently, NDF contributes to the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund, a trust fund that supports the development of sound climate change-related projects in areas of design and procurement readiness.  ADB and NDF have a grant portfolio of 21 projects amounting to $64.5 million. For its collaborations with ADB, NDF prioritizes projects on climate change mitigation and adaptation, infrastructure, natural resources management, and capacity building in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.
