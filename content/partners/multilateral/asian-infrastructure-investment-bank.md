The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), established in 2016, was designed to: (i) foster sustainable economic development, create wealth, and improve infrastructure connectivity in Asia by investing in infrastructure and other productive sectors; and (ii) promote regional cooperation and partnership in addressing development challenges by working in close collaboration with other multilateral and bilateral development institutions. 

ADB and AIIB started collaborating in 2016. To advance a shared goal of an innovative and inclusive region, ADB and AIIB planned a strategic approach to advance toward these developmental goals. This approach prioritizes projects that focus on connectivity through infrastructure, adaptation and resilience to climate change, and an integrated region rooted in cooperation and partnerships.  AIIB is currently cofinancing four projects with ADB amounting to $374 million.
