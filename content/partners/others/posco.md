[POSCO](http://www.posco.com/) is a multinational steel making company promoting new growth engines based on permanent new material and steel, with an ongoing commitment to upholding new values. POSCO was established in 1968 and is headquartered in Pohang, the Republic of Korea. The company demonstrated the fifth largest crude steel production capacity in the world. In line with its vision to engage in promising industries of the future such as green growth projects and in support of the governmentâ€™s initiatives in GHG emissions reduction in developing countries, POSCO is doubling its efforts to cope with the emissions trading system in the Republic of Korea as well as the new climate regime. 

POSCO is a contributor to the Future Carbon Fund with a commitment of US$20 million for purchasing CERs. These activities are meaningful for the company as it puts into practice its social responsibility such as shared growth, policy cooperation, and emissions reduction.
