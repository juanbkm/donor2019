[The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/) is a private foundation established in 1913 to promote the well-being of humanity in the world, catalyze and scale up transformative innovations, and create partnerships across different sectors including energy, health, food security,and smart cities. 

The Rockefeller Foundation collaborates with ADB on a systems-centered approach that supports the integration of climate change into city planning as a central element and links it to the implementation of both infrastructure and institutional interventions. Some of the projects the Rockefeller Foundation cofinanced with ADB include Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program-Tranche 2, Ho Chi Minh City Wastewater and Drainage System Improvement Project, and the Secondary Green Cities Development Project. 

The Rockefeller Foundation has contributed $5 million to the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the [Urban Financing Partnership Facility](./modalities/financing-partnership-facilities/urban-financing-partnership-facility/).
