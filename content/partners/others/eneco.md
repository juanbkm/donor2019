The <a href="https://www.eneco.com/energytrading/">Eneco Energy Trade</a> is a contributor to the Future Carbon Fund (FCF) with a commitment of $15 million. The Eneco Group is a group of companies operating in the field of sustainable energy and innovation that strives to achieve its mission: “Everyone’s sustainable energy.” The Eneco Group invests in wind and solar farms, biomass plants, and green district heating with the aim to increase the share of sustainable energy. The Eneco Group also develops innovative products and services that enable its customers to be in charge of how they generate, store, use, or share energy. 

Headquartered in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the Eneco Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. The Eneco Carbon Desk supports a variety of emission reduction projects around the world, including a number of projects in Southeast Asia through its investment in the FCF. The Carbon Desk invests in projects based on a thorough review and due diligence to ensure that only projects that make a genuine contribution to GHG abatement and visibly improve the livelihoods of surrounding communities are accepted into its portfolio. With that, Eneco can be assured offsets are of the highest quality. Eneco emission reduction projects not only reduce global GHG emissions, but also tell exciting stories about communities that are benefiting from the purchase of carbon credits. This is made visible by reporting its linkages to the SDGs. Carbon offsetting allows organizations and companies to take responsibility for 100% of today’s emissions, by working alongside internal abatement efforts, where any emissions that cannot be reduced internally can be compensated for with high quality carbon credits.
