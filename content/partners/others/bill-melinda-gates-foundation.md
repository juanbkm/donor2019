The [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) is a private foundation founded by Bill and Melinda Gates. It was established in 2000 with the goals to globally enhance healthcare, reduce extreme poverty, and expand educational opportunities and access to information technology. It supports all countries all around the world in the areas of healthcare, education, and poverty alleviation. 

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the single donor to ADB’s Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the [Water Financing Partnership Facility](./modalities/financing-partnership-facilities/water-financing-partnership-facility/), created in 2013.  The Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund aimed to leverage more than $28 million in investments from ADB to expand non-sewered sanitation and septage management solutions across Asia. The trust fund pilots innovations in sanitation and septage management, provide grant funds for innovations in ADB’s sanitation projects, and support policies on septage management and sludge treatment to meet the needs of low-income urban communities who lack access to piped networks or safe wastewater disposal systems. In 2019, it contributed an additional $3 million to the trust fund.
