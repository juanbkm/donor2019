Project-specific cofinancing (PSC) refers to a financing partnership between ADB and donor-partners on individual development projects. Whether through grants, loans, and technical assistance, PSC works especially well in the field, when donors are decentralized operationally and financially, from their headquarters. PSC is generally governed by a cofinancing agreement for ADB-administered cofinancing or a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for cofinancing not administered by ADB.

PSC made up 94% of the 2019 total cofinanced projects, amounting to US$4.71 billion. Japan is top cofinancier for PSC with US$XX. These are some of the more notable projects in 2019

### Billion Dollar Railway

The [Philippines: Malolos-Clark Railway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52083-001/main) is the biggest cofinanced project in 2019.

An important flagship project of ADB’s host country, the Malolos-Clark Railway is also ADB’s single largest infrastructure project financing ever at US$2.75 billion and biggest bilateral partnership in 2019. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is cofinancing the project, which is expected to improve local, national, and international connectivity with the direct link to the international airport at Clark, making it a gateway for Asian destinations. The Philippines received US$2.01 billion or 41% of ADB cofinancing this year.

### Multi-Partners for Policy Reforms

The [Tuvalu: Improved Fiscal and Infrastructure Management Program](https://www.adb.org/projects/50377-001/main) has the most number of financing partners in 2019.

Four partners—Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the World Bank—collaborated with ADB in this policy-based program that supported reforms to improve the management of public finance and national infrastructure. The program strengthened Tuvalu’s fiscal sustainability by supporting priority policy actions under the government’s rolling multiyear policy reform matrix. The ADB assistance was policy-based, meaning the funds are released as budget support once policy actions outlined in the program are successfully completed.

### New Project with a New Partner

The [India: Mumbai Metro Rail Systems Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49469-007/main) marks ADB’s first cofinancing with new partner New Development Bank (NDB). The project will ease travel for millions of commuters across Mumbai, help decongest heavily crowded suburban rail systems, and contribute to providing a modern, clean, and livable urban environment.

The Shanghai-based NDB is a new multilateral development bank setup in 2015 by five BRICS countries to mobilize resources for development projects in BRICS, emerging economies and developing countries. ADB and NDB signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in July 2016.

### Partnership to Generate More Partnerships

The financing partnership among ADB, France, and Germany on the [People's Republic of China: Shandong Green Development Fund Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51194-001/main) is expected to create ripples of new partnerships with the private sector in climate financing.

The project will help establish the Shandong Green Development Fund (SGDF) and attract private, institutional, and commercial financing for climate mitigation and adaptation projects. In fact, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) approved US$100 million for the project in November 2019, the first GCF funding for the People’s Republic of China. By catalyzing climate finance, the SGDF is expected to help reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million tons per year and directly build resilience for at least 2 million people in Shandong Province.

### Long Arms of Cofinancing

The [Regional: Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase IV](https://www.adb.org/projects/53072-001/main) (PSDI IV) is the PSC with the broadest and furthest reach, providing advisory and capacity-building assistance to all 14 Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to improve the PICs business enabling environments. The multi-phased initiative is expected to support inclusive, private sector-led economic growth in the Pacific subregion. The fourth phase is financed by Australia.

PSDI IV will build on past achievements across six core areas of focus: access to finance, business law reform, state-owned enterprise reform, public-private partnerships, competition and consumer protection, and the economic empowerment of women. The 14 PICs are Cook Islands, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
