      The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), established in 2008, is a global finance mechanism that aims to help developing countries shift to low carbon technologies and promote climate resilient development. There are two funding windows under CIF: Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). CTF finances to promote the use of low carbon technologies with a significant potential for long-term greenhouse gas emissions savings, while SCF finances new development approaches or scale-up activities geared toward specific climate change challenge or sectoral response. CIF works with multilateral organizations like the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank Group.
      
      In 2019, the SCF cofinanced projects on the [development of a national solar park in Cambodia](https://www.adb.org/projects/51182-001/main), [scaling up energy efficiency in India](https://www.adb.org/projects/52196-001/main), and [establishment of an energy investment facility in the Pacific Region](https://www.adb.org/projects/49450-022/main). The CTF, on the other hand, cofinanced a project on the [promotion of low-carbon development in Central Asia](https://www.adb.org/projects/50287-001/main).

      * help developing countries achieve food security and higher income
      * provide multi-sector investments to fill national and regional financing gaps in food security strategies
      * scale up promising agricultural technologies

      Specifically, GAFSP’s public sector funding window assists strategic country or regional programs from sector-wide country or regional consultations. The private sector window provides long and short-term loans, credit guarantees, and equity to support private sector activities for improving agricultural development and food security.

      In 2019, the GAFSP cofinanced a project on [evaluating climate-friendly agribusiness value chains interventions in Myanmar](https://www.adb.org/projects/48409-005/main).

      * reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries
      * help vulnerable societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change

      GCF aims to catalyze a flow of climate finance to invest in low-emission and climate-resilient development, driving a paradigm shift in the global response to climate change. The Fund’s investments can be in the form of grants, loans, equity, or guarantees.

Global funds are funding initiatives managed by other multilateral banks. Through ADB, the developing member countries can access these global funds, for which the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development serves as trustee.  

Global funds leverage public or private resources in support of international initiatives, enabling partners to provide direct and coordinated response to global priorities. ADB contributes to the Global Funds and assists developing member countries in gaining access to its financing.  

In 2019, loan cofinancing from global funds reached $152 million while grant cofinancing, for both investment grants and technical assistance, reached $54.5 million. The Green Climate Fund was a significant contributor, with a $95 million loan cofinancing for Mongolia’s Ulaanbaatar Green Affordable Housing and Resilient Urban Renewal Sector Project and a $30 million grant for Tonga’s Renewable Energy Project.
