As of 2019, the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF) has supported projects that are expected to reduced emissions in ADB’s developing member countries (DMCs) by 24.8 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e) per year, surpassing its 2020 target of 20 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year. Meanwhile, the CEFPF’s other targets—improved energy savings, installed renewable energy capacity, and renewable energy generation—are well within reach. To date, CEFPF has provided 392,887 households with access to clean energy. It has also helped increase clean energy investments in DMCs, leveraging from the ADB, the private sector and the non-private sector about $8.3 billion of clean energy investment.

ADB established the CEFPF in 2007 in view of the escalating energy demand in Asia and the Pacific and the increasingly felt effects of climate change. CEFPF helps DMCs improve their energy security and transition to low-carbon use through cost-effective investments.

In line with the ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority: Tackling Climate Change, Building Climate and Disaster Resilience, and Enhancing Environmental Sustainability, the CEFPF continues to support the energy sector in achieving its climate financing target, providing financial and technical support to DMC to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions, and reducing GHG emissions through clean energy projects and programs.

In the coming decade, CEFPF will also continue to support projects that focus on energy efficiency, access to energy, renewable energy, carbon capture, utilization and storage, sustainable transport, as well as projects that will engage the private sector to invest in clean energy. It will prioritize support for project preparatory assistance for clean energy and energy access related projects, and pilot projects which will deliver innovative designs and high-level technology adoption and deployment in the DMCs.
