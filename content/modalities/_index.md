  ADB Strategy 2030 calls for building strong partnerships with diverse institutions, such as private and public financial institutions and traditional and new development partners. ADB’s financing partners heeded this call in 2019, committing about $4.71 billion in loans and grants for specific projects and $181 million for ADB’s trust funds. 

  ADB’s financing partners have two modalities for cofinancing with ADB─they can cofinance individual projects, programs, or technical assistance, referred to as “project-specific cofinancing,” or they can create a trust fund or contribute to one or more of ADB’s existing trust funds. 

  Financing partners keen on strategic long-term collaborations may agree with ADB on an indicative amount of development finance for a specific amount of time, which can be divvied up into specific projects or trust funds. In such cases, ADB and the financing partner sign a partnership framework agreement to formalize and define the partnership in broad terms.
