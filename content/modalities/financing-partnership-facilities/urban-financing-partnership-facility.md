In April 2019, ADB approved the establishment of a fourth trust fund under the UFPF umbrella, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund (AASCTF). AASCTF aims to improve systems and governance in participating cities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through the adaptation and adoption of digital solutions. 

Established in 2009, the UFPF supports the development of Asia’s cities while addressing pervasive urban issues such as pollution, uneven growth, and urban poverty.  

In the next decade, the UFPF will be guided by ADB’s new Livable Cities Operational Priority Plan 2019–2024, which is in line with ADB 2030’s operational priority on [Making Cities More Livable](./strategy-2030/livable-cities/). The Livable Cities Operational Priority Plan is anchored on three main operational priorities: 

* improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and reliability of services in urban areas 
* strengthen urban planning and financial sustainability of cities 
* improve the urban environment, climate resilience, and disaster management of cities, all of which are closely aligned with the targeted areas of support of UFPF
