Now celebrating a decade of cofinancing, the [Urban Financing Partnership Facility](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/urban-financing-partnership-facility) (UFPF) has completed 152 projects that helped build green, competitive, resilient, and inclusive cities.

UFPF has $191.9 million total contributions, with $34.9 million committed to 17 projects in 2019. A total of $154.24 million has been committed to 117 projects.

In April 2019, ADB approved the establishment of a fourth trust fund under the UFPF umbrella, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund (AASCTF). AASCTF aims to improve systems and governance in participating cities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through the adaptation and adoption of digital solutions.

CDIATF’s support helped identify specific investment projects that would benefit urban populations in four cities, with improved water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management services, and the introduction of green spaces." >}}

Established in 2009, the UFPF supports the development of Asia’s cities while addressing pervasive urban issues such as pollution, uneven growth, and urban poverty.  

In the next decade, the UFPF will be guided by ADB’s new [Livable Cities Operational Priority Plan 2019–2024](https://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2030-op4-livable-cities), which is in line with ADB 2030’s operational priority on [Making Cities More Livable](./strategy-2030/livable-cities/). The Livable Cities Operational Priority Plan is anchored on three main operational priorities: 

* improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and reliability of services in urban areas 
* strengthen urban planning and financial sustainability of cities 
* improve the urban environment, climate resilience, and disaster management of cities, all of which are closely aligned with the targeted areas of support of UFPF
