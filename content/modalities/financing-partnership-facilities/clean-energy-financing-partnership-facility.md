  *Projects applying for CEFPF resources are screened vis-à-vis their alignment with CEFPF objectives. Projects that pass this screening receive an authorization from the Climate Change Steering Committee (CCSC), and this triggers CEFPF to allocate funds for them. Projects with CCSC authorization can now include CEFPF funding in its project documents and proceed with regular ADB approval process. "Allocation," therefore, refers to CEFPF resources earmarked for projects authorized by the CCSC, which may include projects that are still awaiting approval by ADB.

As of 2019, the [Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/clean-energy-financing-partnership-facility) (CEFPF) has supported projects that are expected to reduce emissions in ADB’s developing member countries (DMCs) by 24.8 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e) per year, surpassing its 2020 target of 20 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year. Meanwhile, the CEFPF’s other targets—improved energy savings, installed renewable energy capacity, and renewable energy generation—are well within reach. To date, CEFPF has provided 392,887 households with access to clean energy. It has also helped increase clean energy investments in DMCs, leveraging from ADB, the private sector and the non-private sector about $8.3 billion of clean energy investment.

Total contributions received by the CEFPF reached $295.5 million, with $5.7 million allocated* for projects in 2019. Total allocations for projects amount to $266.7 million.

{{< dr-artimage src="./images/modalities/floating-solar.jpg" width="80%" caption="**Floating Solar Power.** These floating solar photovoltaic power generation panels at the Da Mi Hydropower Plant in Binh Thuan, Viet Nam is part of [ADB’s Viet Nam: Floating Solar Energy Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51327-001/main). The Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility approved $11 million concessional financing to the project to offset the higher installation costs of a floating solar project compared to land-mounted solar project and the need to import most of the equipment.

ADB established the CEFPF in 2007 in view of the escalating energy demand in Asia and the Pacific and the increasingly felt effects of climate change. CEFPF helps DMCs improve their energy security and transition to low-carbon use through cost-effective investments.

In line with the ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority: Tackling [Climate Change, Building Climate and Disaster Resilience, and Enhancing Environmental Sustainability](./strategy-2030/climate-change/), the CEFPF continues to support the energy sector in achieving its climate financing target, providing financial and technical support to DMCs to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through clean energy projects and programs.

In the coming decade, CEFPF will also continue to support projects that focus on energy efficiency, access to energy, renewable energy, carbon capture, utilization and storage, sustainable transport, as well as projects that will engage the private sector to invest in clean energy. It will prioritize support for project preparatory assistance for clean energy and energy access related projects, and pilot projects which will deliver innovative designs and high-level technology adoption and deployment in the DMCs.
