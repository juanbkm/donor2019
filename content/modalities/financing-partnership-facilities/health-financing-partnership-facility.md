Primarily to improve the health outcomes in ADB developing member countries, the [Health Financing Partnership Facility](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/hfpf) was established in 2013, concurrently with the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund (RMTF), which is the first trust fund under the facility.  

The HFPF has $29.4 million in total committed contributions, with $28.5 million committed for 5 projects, all under the RMTF. It has about $729,000 remaining balance due to income earned from investment.

{{< dr-artimage src="./images/modalities/hfpf-mi.jpg" width="80%" caption="**Combatting Malaria.** The Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund under the Health Financing Partnership Facility financed a $4.5 million technical assistance, the [Regional: Malaria and Communicable Diseases Control in the Greater Mekong Subregion](https://www.adb.org/projects/48446-001/main). The project helped to improve malaria surveillance and diagnostic systems in Myanmar, addressed the specific needs for malaria prevention and treatment of mobile and migrant populations, and strengthened regional coordination on malaria and communicable diseases control among countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion.

The RMTF supported multi-country, cross-border, and multisector responses to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Through its projects, RMTF advocated for a collaborative approach to malaria elimination that goes beyond the health  sector and national governments to draw in the private sector, nongovernment agencies, and the donor community across multiple domains, with a focus on health systems strengthening, rather than on a single disease. An important financing result of the RMTF was the issuance of ADB’s first health bond. The private placement of $100 million issued in March 2017 was purchased by the Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, making it the world’s first institutional investor to buy a bond that supports ADB’s health program.  

While contributions from Australia and the United Kingdom closed in 2018, a sustainability pathway was left in place to ensure that the results continue to resonate and that governments, donors, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector can continue to build on what has been achieved.

In 2019, the remaining resources of the RMTF was used to help ensure that ADB’s ongoing support for regional health security is properly aligned with ADB Strategy 2030’s focus on universal health coverage, regional cooperation and integration, and the promotion of the use of digital health and adoption of inter-operability of health information systems.
