In 2019, the remaining resources of the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund (RMTF) was used to help ensure that ADB’s ongoing support for regional health security is properly aligned with ADB Strategy 2030’s focus on universal health coverage, regional cooperation and integration, and the promotion of the use of digital health and adoption of inter-operability of health information systems.

The HFPF has $29.4 million in total committed contributions, with $28.5 million committed for 5 projects, all under the RMTF. It has about $729,000 remaining balance due to income earned from investment.

Primarily to improve the health outcomes in DMCs, the Health Financing Partnership Facility (HFPF) was established in 2013, concurrently with the RMTF, which is the first and only trust fund under the facility. RMTF supported multi-country, cross-border, and multisector responses to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Through its projects, RMTF advocated for a collaborative approach to malaria elimination that goes beyond the health sector and national governments to draw in the private sector, nongovernment agencies, and the donor community across multiple domains, with a focus on health systems strengthening, rather than on a single disease. An important financing result of the RMTF was the issuance of ADB’s first health bond. The private placement of $100 million issued in March 2017 was purchased by the Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, making it the world’s first institutional investor to buy a bond that supports ADB’s health program. In 2018, the [RMTF Final Report](https://www.adb.org/publications/malaria-trust-fund-report) was published.

While contributions from Australia and the United Kingdom closed in 2018, a sustainability pathway was left in place to ensure that the results continue to resonate and that governments, donors, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector can continue to build on what has been achieved. The remaining contribution from Canada was agreed to remain in the fund.
