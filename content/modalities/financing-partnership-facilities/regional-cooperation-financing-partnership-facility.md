The project will support the development of action plans and policies to address marine plastic pollution and investments in reducing plastic pollution. It will also improve knowledge, regional cooperation, and financing for marine plastic pollution solutions." >}}

RCIF is the backbone of the RCIFPF. As an ADB special fund, the RCIF is open to all the developing member countries and all the subregional cooperation programs of ADB, including the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, the Greater Mekong Subregion Program, and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program.

The ICFF was established in 2008 to help address the challenges of promoting investments and facilitate regional cooperation and integration through the construction of basic infrastructure, improvements in investment climate, capacity building, and promotion of good governance, among others. ICFF is used to finance technical assistance and grant components of investment projects that contribute directly to poverty reduction. 

The United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity was established in 2018. The objective of the fund is to support the implementation of ADB’s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016–2020 by financing regional cooperation and integration activities in selected DMCs in Central and South Asia, leading to improved integration with other regions of the world.
