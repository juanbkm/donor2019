Established in 2007, the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility (RCIFPF) provides continued and consistent technical assistance support for the implementation of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy and the related operational plans. It includes  

* Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund (RCIF), a special fund established by ADB*  
* Investment Climate Facilitation Fund (ICFF), a trust funded financed by Japan 
* Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity Fund (ARTCF), a trust fund financed by the United Kingdom 

As a special fund of ADB, the RCIF is open to all the developing member countries and all the subregional cooperation programs of ADB, including the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, the Greater Mekong Subregion Program, and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program. The RCIF has also supported multiple sectors. As the backbone of the RCIFPF, the RCIF has catalyzed a total of $58.0 million in cofinancing at the project level from development partners, equivalent to 80% of cumulative contributions to the RCIF. 

The Investment Climate Facilitation Fund was established in 2008 to help address the challenges of promoting investment and tackling climate change through energy efficiency. Its objective is to finance technical assistance and grants to investment projects that promote investments in DMCs and facilitate regional cooperation and integration through construction of basic infrastructure, facilitation of investment climate, capacity building, and promotion of good governance. 

The United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity was established in 2018. The objective of the fund is to support the implementation of ADB’s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016–2020 by financing regional cooperation and integration activities in selected DMCs in Central and South Asia, leading to improved integration with other regions of the world.
