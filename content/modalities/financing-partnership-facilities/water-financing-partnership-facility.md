      The MDTF received a contribution of $700,000 (A$1 million) from Australia in 2019.

      The MDTF prioritizes activities designed to result in significantly more people with access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, higher productivity and efficiency of irrigation and drainage services, more people with reduced risk of flooding; sustainable  management of water resources; increased knowledge and capacity; and improved sector governance. Norway was a contributor to the MDTF from 2007 to 2017.

       In 2019, the SFPTF received a contribution of $3 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 
       
       SFPTF initially focused on innovative sanitation solutions to increase support for fecal sludge management through non-networked (non-sewered) sanitation and septage management. The focus has now shifted to more holistic approach through the citywide inclusive sanitation framework to increase access to appropriate sanitation systems, whether sewered or non-sewered, centralized or decentralized, including the required support to increase knowledge and capacity and improve governance.

As of December 2019, the [Water Financing Partnership Facility](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/water-financing-partnership-facility) (WFPF) has helped realize a total of $7.88 billion in water investments that will benefit 116 million people in Asia and the Pacific. This surpasses the WFPF target to support 115 million people as part of the overall beneficiaries for committed ADB water projects from 2006 up to 2020. Of these 116 million people, about 71 million would have sustainable access to improved water supply and sanitation, about 30 million would be safer from flood risks, and about 15 million would have more efficient and productive irrigation and drainage services.

WFPF’s total committed contributions has reached $116.4 million. In 2019, allocations were approved for 21 applications amounting to $9.7 million. As of 31 December 2019, total approved allocations at the Facility level amounted to $105.2 million.

The project will modernize agriculture production systems and minimize nonpoint source pollution in the Yangtze River Basin. Water experts were engaged to undertake site assessments and guide the detailed project design." >}}

The WFPF pools financial resources from donors to support ADB’s [Water Financing Program](https://www.adb.org/sectors/water/financing-program), which has been driving ADB’s water investments in the past 15 years. Currently, the program targets 765 million people to have sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation, reduced risks to floods, and more productive irrigation and drainage services by 2020. 

The WFPF was established in 2006 amid global calls for doubling of water investments and was the first FPF to be introduced to financing partners. Its aim is to support ADB's water operations directly to catalyze water investments. Today, the WFPF has evolved to become the go-to fund for ADB projects and programs on water supply, sanitation, and wastewater management; irrigation and drainage; flood management; and water resources development and management, and other projects that contribute to achieving ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities, especially those related to [food security](./strategy-2030/rural-development-and-food-security/), [climate change](./strategy-2030/climate-change/), and [livable cities](./strategy-2030/livable-cities/).
