Trust funds provide platforms for partners to channel restricted grants for a specific group of countries, focus areas, or program. These single-partner and multi-partner trust funds are fully administered by ADB as trustee. Some of these trust funds also fall under umbrella financing partnership facilities, which serve as platforms for long-term and multipartner cooperation that links various forms of assistance in a coordinated matter.

ADB continues to develop, facilitate, and implement partnerships through trust funds with specific thematic focus. As of 2019, ADB managed a total of 45 trust funds, with total commitment of $181 million in 2019. While this represents only 4% of the $4.87 billion total sovereign cofinancing for the year, it funded 97 of 2019’s 148 unique cofinanced activities.

The largest commitments in support of the ADB’s sovereign operations were from the Asia Project Preparation Facility, a multi-donor trust fund funded by Australia, Canada and Japan, and its $45 million grant to support the preparation of infrastructure projects in the region . The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction supported the greatest number of projects, 21, with grant cofinancing totaling $37.8 million. This support spans across agriculture, e.g., the enhancement of technology-based agriculture and marketing in Pakistan; health, e.g., reducing maternal and child mortality in Uzbekistan and supporting adolescent nutrition in Indonesia; and disaster resilience, e.g., preparations to alleviate effects of floods in Fiji. The Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) was established with an initial €12 million contribution from Ireland to help SIDS manage disasters caused by natural hazards and the impacts of climate change.

Of the 45 ADB-managed trust funds, 14 are housed under ADB’s Financing Partnerships Facilities (FPFs), which offer partners an opportunity for long-term investments in key development priorities aligned with ADB’s corporate initiatives. Currently, there are five FPFs focused on clean energy, health, regional cooperation and integration, urban development, and water.

FPFs are operational mechanisms for strategic, long-term, multi-partner cooperation. They have set targets and objectives, ensure a steady and coordinated flow of funds, and are intensively managed to ensure that these goals are achieved, from application processing to project development and results monitoring. In 2019, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities was established under the Urban Financing Partnerships Facility with an initial funding of $15.2 million. It aims to improve systems and governance among participating ASEAN cities through the adaptation and adoption of digital solutions.
