      The Future Carbon Fund supports efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission in Asia and the Pacific through the pre-purchase of certified emission reductions (CERs) generated by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in the 2013–2020 period. The Fund’s continued operations and its ability to purchase CERs on fixed price and provide upfront financing contribute to the successful implementation of climate change mitigation projects in the region. The fund is supporting a diversified portfolio of 36 CDM projects, allocating $59.8 million for the purchase of 10.56 million CERs. The fund’s work is well-distributed across Asia and the Pacific region with 10 projects located in India, eight in Thailand, six in the People's Republic of China, two each in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and one each in Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. The portfolio is also diversified in terms of project type, with projects spanning over renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, and transport sectors.
