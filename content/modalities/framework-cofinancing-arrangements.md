      ADB’s and Agence Française de Développement (AFD)’s partnership is built on their common goal of inclusive development and sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific. In 2019, these two institutions strengthened their partnership by amending their existing Partnership Framework Agreement (PFA)-- originally signed in 2016-- to increase their commitment from $1.5 billion each to $2.5 billion each. In the first 3 years of the PFA, the two have exceeded their original individual commitment of $1.5 million, with France committing $1.58 billion. Two projects were approved for cofinancing under this arrangement in 2019-- the [Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program—Tranche 2](https://www.adb.org/projects/47037-005/main#project-pds) in Sri Lanka and the [Shandong Green Development Fund in the People’s Republic of China](https://www.adb.org/projects/51194-001/main#project-pds).

      The PFA details the two organizations’ arrangements on enhancing institutional, research, and knowledge cooperation. It also reflects how they will pursue their operational cooperation in the form of cofinancing, joint research and development of knowledge products, a staff exchange program, and regular policy dialogue in the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

Framework Cofinancing Arrangements (FCAs) encompass a wide range of partnerships that facilitates better planning and coordination of joint cofinancing activities. They help increase the predictability of cofinancing volumes, reduce the need for detailed negotiations for each transaction, and streamline processes for reporting and information exchange. An agreement or memorandum of understanding serves as documentation for FCAs. In particular, FCAs

* formalize the country, sector, and drivers of change priorities of the financing partner
* establish the terms and mode of cofinancing
* identify the roles and responsibilities of each party (such as project administration and information sharing); and/or
* indicate the financing partner’s amount available for cofinancing over a period.

In 2019, ADB had active FCAs with 13 financing partners, with a total funding envelope of US$18.75 billion. Under these agreements, ten projects amounting to $3.74 billion were signed in 2019.
