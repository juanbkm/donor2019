Framework Cofinancing Arrangements (FCAs) encompass a wide range of partnerships that facilitates better planning and coordination of joint cofinancing activities. They help increase the predictability of cofinancing volumes, reduce the need for detailed negotiations for each transaction, and streamline processes for reporting and information exchange. An agreement or memorandum of understanding serves as documentation for FCAs. In particular, FCAs

* formalize the country, sector, and drivers of change priorities of the financing partner
* establish the terms and mode of cofinancing
* identify the roles and responsibilities of each party (such as project administration and information sharing); and/or
* indicate the financing partner’s amount available for cofinancing over a period.

In 2019, ADB had active FCAs with 13 financing partners, with a total funding envelope of US$18.75 billion. Under these agreements, ten projects amounting to $3.74 billion were signed in 2019.
