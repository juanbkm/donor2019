summary: Partnership framework arrangements (PFAs) facilitate better planning and coordination of joint cofinancing activities. They enable ADB and a partner to cofinance projects—either as PSCs or via trust funds─ that match their sector and country priorities over a specific period of time. PFAs allow both parties to commit and pool resources that will support their common project pipeline. This type of arrangement increases the predictability of cofinancing volumes. They also make negotiations for individual projects in the pipeline, and the reporting and exchange of information on said projects, a little easier.

      ADB and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) signed their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Establishing Cooperation Arrangements in February 2012. They extended it in September 2015 to cover collaboration from 2015 until 2020. Under this arrangement, ADFD provided $30 million to cofinance a transport project in 2019. 

      The arrangement between ADB and ADFD provides a general framework for both institutions to develop and undertake collaborative work to pursue common objectives more strategically and effectively. Their priority sectors of cooperation are education, energy, finance, health, regional initiatives, trade, transport, and urban services.

      ADB’s and Agence Française de Développement (AFD)’s partnership is built on their common goal of inclusive development and sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific.  In 2019, these two institutions strengthened their partnership by amending their existing Partnership Framework Agreement (PFA)-- originally signed in 2016--to increase their commitments from $1.5 billion each for the first 3 years to $2.5 billion each for the succeeding 3 years.  In the first 3 years of the PFA, the two have exceeded their original individual commitment of $1.5 million, with France committing $1.58 billion. Two projects were committed for cofinancing under this arrangement in 2019-- the [Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program—Tranche 2](https://www.adb.org/projects/47037-005/main#project-pds) in Sri Lanka and the [Shandong Green Development Fund in the People’s Republic of China](https://www.adb.org/projects/51194-001/main#project-pds).

      The PFA details the two organizations’ arrangements on enhancing institutional, research, and knowledge cooperation. It also reflects how they will pursue their operational cooperation in the form of cofinancing, joint research and development of knowledge products, a staff exchange program, and regular policy dialogue in the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

PFAs can come in different forms—from a memorandum of understanding to an aide memoire to a framework cofinancing agreement─ depending on the preferences and limitations of a financing partner. For instance, ADB and the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) have a Partnership Framework Arrangement, ADB and the Eurasian Development Bank have a Framework Cofinancing Arrangement, and ADB and KfW have a Memorandum of Agreement.

Generally, PFAs detail the guiding principles of the partnership, the institutions’ common objectives, the scope of their cooperation and activities, and processes for monitoring, reporting, information exchange, and evaluation. PFAs may be updated through exchanges of letters. Specifically, PFAs

* formalize the country, sector, and drivers of change priorities of the financing partner

* establish the terms and mode of cofinancing

* identify the roles and responsibilities of each party (such as project administration and information sharing)

* indicate the financing partner’s amount available for cofinancing over a period

ADB’s first PFA was with the Government of Japan in 2007. This FPA, which they formalized as the “Framework Agreement for the Implementation of the Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme,” committed between $1 billion and $2 billion (equivalent) over 5 years for projects that enhance climate investments, strengthen regional cooperation, and support energy efficiency for countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Pacific. This was followed by agreements with the Republic of Korea and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in 2008, the People’s Republic of China in 2009, and France's AFD in 2010.

In 2019, ADB had active FPAs with 11 financing partners, with a total funding envelope of about $20.25 billion. Two were expanded in 2019—those for the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the KfW—and one was newly signed with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Under all active FCAs, ten projects amounting to $3.74 billion were signed in 2019. This represents 77% of sovereign cofinancing operations for the year.
