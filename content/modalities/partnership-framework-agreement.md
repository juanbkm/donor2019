summary: |
  Partnership framework agreements (PFAs), also expressed as framework cofinancing arrangements (FCAs), memoranda of understanding (MOU), and similar terms, facilitate strategic collaboration, cooperation, and complementarity. PFAs involve a funding envelope to cover a broad range of planned and coordinated cofinancing activities over a period. In 2019, ADB had active PFAs with 12 financing partners, with a total funding envelope of roughly $20 billion.
