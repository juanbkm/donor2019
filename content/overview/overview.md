Thanks in large measure to financing partnerships, ADB operations reached $33.75 billion in 2019. Cofinancing totaled $11.86 billion, leveraged by $21.89 billion in ADB’s own loans, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. Of these, sovereign cofinancing for both investment projects and technical assistance reached $4.87 billion, representing almost a quarter of ADB’s sovereign operations.

For 2019, ADB successfully collaborated with 33 different partners on 148 projects supportive of sovereign operations in 24 developing member countries.

### Exploring New Opportunities

Sovereign cofinancing in 2019 saw ADB venturing into new fields and with new partners.

The 52nd ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji (May 2019) coincided with financing partners’ increasing interest in the Pacific region, e.g., United Kingdom’s re-engagement with the region by establishing diplomatic representation in Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu in 2018. The meeting also put a spotlight on the Pacific region’s needs and opened opportunities for stronger partnerships. In April 2019, the [Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/ireland-trust-fund-climate-change-disaster-resilience-sids) (SIDS) was established to help SIDS manage disasters caused by natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. The fund had an initial €12 million contribution from Ireland.

The same annual meeting also launched ADB’s initial foray into ocean health, the [Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies for Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-launches-5-billion-healthy-oceans-action-plan), which aims to expand financing for ocean health and marine economy to $5 billion from 2019 to 2024. Preliminary action such as stakeholder mapping and consultations have taken place in the latter half of 2019. The year also saw gradual but consistent progress in terms of engaging with partners not so familiar with ADB. For instance, steady dialogue with JPMorgan culminated in a partnership focusing on advancing women and trade, with JPMorgan committing $1.36 million as grant.

### Building on Past Successes

Continued and expanded cooperation with ADB’s traditional partners comprised the bulk of 2019’s cofinancing activities. In February, ADB and Agence Francaise de Developpement amended their existing Partnership Framework Agreement to increase their cofinancing commitment from $3 billion in the past 3 years to $5 billion in the next 3 years. A month later, ADB and the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank signed their first cofinancing framework agreement. Throughout the year, two new trust funds were established and 13 received replenishments from their donors, with the new trust fund commitments and replenishments totaling $399 million. Climate financing continued to be a priority for ADB and 2019 was the year it attained the $6 billion climate financing target it set for itself in 2016, one year ahead of its 2020 target schedule. Before the year ended, KfW expanded its existing $4 billion cofinancing commitment for 2014-2019 with another $2 billion until 2013.

In terms of commitments, Japan, Germany, Republic of Korea, France, and Australia continued to show their alignment with ADB’s thrusts by being the bilateral financing partners with the most cofinancing commitments in 2019. Their counterpart among multilateral financing partners were the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, New Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, and the World Bank. As with 2018, transport, energy, and public sector management projects received most of the cofinancing. Unlike in 2018, though, where the education sector received the 2nd most cofinancing at $1.42 billion for 11 projects, 2019 cofinancing for the education projects radically declined to $9 million for 9 projects. Cofinancing for transport sector projects more than doubled at $2.72 billion for 17 projects.

The Philippines received a significant portion of 2019’s sovereign cofinancing, largely due to the Malolos-Clark Railway Project, ADB’s largest infrastructure financing project to date. But in terms of number of projects, Mongolia, Indonesia, and Pakistan had the most at 11, 10, and 9, respectively.

As the COVID-10 global pandemic unfolds, and new priorities emerge on top of the existing needs of the region─ from bolstering health systems of DMCs to setting up economic and social safeguards for the vulnerable sectors to stimulating economies that stalled or slowed down in the pandemic─ ADB’s partnerships need to be all the stronger to continue working for a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.
