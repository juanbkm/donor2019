Through its work with partners, ADB can mobilize additional financial and technical resources for its support for its Developing Member Countries (DMCs). Partnerships can also help improve coordination and reduce fragmentation of the support provided to DMCs. Finally, partnerships can help deliver outcomes that would not have been possible if either the ADB or the partner had operated in isolation. 

The 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a summary of the different types of financing partnerships that supported the ADB’s sovereign operations in 2019, including loan cofinancing; grant cofinancing, for both investment projects and technical assistance (TA); and through Trust Funds. The virtual format of the report allows the reader to explore which partners the ADB initiated new partnership with in 2019, for which type of activities, and in which countries and sectors.

Equally important, the 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a large number of impact stories that illustrate and explain how partnership initiatives from the earlier years are delivering concrete impacts on the ground, in alignment with [Strategy 2030’s seven Operational Priorities](./strategy-2030/). 

Overall, sovereign cofinancing reached $4.89 billion, contributing to total ADB sovereign operations worth $23.75 billion.  That means that every dollar of ADB sovereign financing was accompanied by about 25 cents of cofinancing from partners. In 2019, ADB successfully collaborated with 33 different partners on 148 individual cofinancing operations that supported sovereign operations in 24 DMCs.

### Loan Cofinancing

By far the largest volume of cofinancing—$ 4.52 billion—in 2019 was loan cofinancing, where partners provided DMCs with funding that support the intended outcomes from ADB operations. 2019 saw ADB’s second largest-ever, single cofinancing operation, namely the collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on the [Malolos-Clark Railway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52083-001/main#project-pds). The project is among ADB’s largest infrastructure projects to date, cofinanced by JICA in the amount of $ 2.01 billion. 2019 also saw renewed commitments to seek cofinancing by both existing and new partners. For example, in February 2019, ADB and Agence Francaise de Developpement amended their existing Partnership Framework Agreement for 2016-2022 to increase their cofinancing commitment from $3 billion to $5 billion. A month later, ADB and the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank signed their first cofinancing framework agreement. And in November 2019, KfW topped up its existing $4 billion cofinancing commitment for 2014-2019 with another $2 billion until 2023.

### Grant Cofinancing

2019 further expanded ADB’s work with partners through grant-based project-specific confinancing, in which partners provided dedicated funding to specific ADB projects. In 2019, there were total of 39 individual project-specific cofinancing projects, for both investment projects and technical assistance, worth $ 191 million. Of this, $128 million was for investment projects, while $63 million was for technical assistance operations. Australia was the largest bilateral provider of project specific cofinancing in 2019, supporting a total of 18 projects worth $83 million, including, for example, the  [Renewable Energy Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49450-012/main#project-pds) in Tonga and the [Northern Mountain Provinces Transport Connectivity](https://www.adb.org/projects/50098-002/main#project-pds) in Viet Nam. Among multilateral partners, the largest amounts were from the Green Climate Fund and the European Union. The year also saw gradual but consistent progress in terms of engaging with partners not so familiar with ADB. For instance, steady dialogue with JPMorgan Chase Foundation culminated in the first-ever partnership focusing on advancing women and trade, with JPMorgan committing a grant of $1.29 million.  

### Trust Funds

ADB continues to develop, facilitate, and implement partnerships through trust funds with specific thematic focus. As of 2019, ADB managed a total of 45 trust funds, with total commitment of $181 million in 2019. The largest commitments in support of the ADB’s sovereign operations were from the Asia Project Preparation Facility, a multi-donor trust fund funded by Australia, Canada and Japan, and from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. Two new trust funds were also established in 2019:

* [Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States (SIDS)](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/ireland-trust-fund-climate-change-disaster-resilience-sids), with an initial €12 million contribution from Ireland, to help SIDS manage disasters caused by natural hazards and the impacts of climate change

* [ASEAN Australia Smart Cities](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/asean-australia-smart-cities-fund), established under the Urban Financing Partnerships. Facility and with an initial funding of $15.24 million, aims to improve systems and governance among participating ASEAN cities through the adaptation and adoption of digital solutions. 

As the COVID-10 global pandemic unfolds, and new priorities emerge on top of the existing needs of the region─ from bolstering  health systems of DMCs to setting up economic and social safeguards for the vulnerable sectors to stimulating economies that stalled or slowed down in the pandemic─ ADB’s partnerships need to be all the stronger to continue working for a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.
