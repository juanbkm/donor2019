### Shifts and Turns in Cofinancing

Financing partnerships are critical to delivering ADB’s Strategy 2030. Under Strategy 2030, approved in 2018, ADB will sustain its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty while expanding its vision of a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific. ADB will combine finance, knowledge, and partnerships to fulfill this expanded vision. Strategy 2030 enjoins ADB and its financing partners to mobilize resources for ADB’s operations, test ideas, and develop and share knowledge. 2019 continues the journey for ADB’s financing partnerships working more intensely towards shared progress in helping to achieve the Strategy 2030 vision.

The year however is replete with shifts and turns in the flow of development aid and finance and the continuing changes in international development cooperation. These changes were triggered by divergent drivers such as the perceived decline in the relevance of aid as a financial resource, global migration trends, the graduation of receiving countries, and a proliferation of development actors and cooperation goals. Many of ADB’s bilateral financing partners, particularly those based in Europe, have continued to shift the focus of their development assistance from Asia to Africa or the refugee crisis. Some partners have also been tasked to redefine their safeguards and reporting requirements and align them across their engagement partners, e.g., on the topic of sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment. All these make for a challenging environment.

Nevertheless, cofinancing commitments from partners totaled $11.9 billion in 2019, over one-third of ADB’s total operations of $33.75 billion. Of these, $4.89 billion went into sovereign operations.

In absolute terms, 2019 sovereign cofinancing declined by 25% compared to 2018’s $6.49 billion. A total of $1.97 billion worth of projects, however, were not counted as sovereign cofinancing.

Why? Because ADB has also shifted the focus of its sovereign cofinancing operations from volume to quality and value-addition. Under this approach, ADB only counts and reports cofinancing activities a) that are needed to deliver the outcome of a project, b) that ADB mobilizes directly, or c) that ADB is fully or partially administering. This shift stems from the recognition that setting high numerical cofinancing targets does not necessarily lead to high-value projects significantly benefiting ADB’s developing member countries. Rather, it acknowledges that ADB’s financing partnerships can do more than “cofinance” a project, that they can also leverage new knowledge, and that they can lead to more robust, more strategic partnerships as well. This perspective is one of strategic financing partnerships that lead to shared progress.

### Building Strategic Partnerships

In 2019, ADB sought strategic financing partnerships that promised to help make Asia and the Pacific’s future a lot brighter. These ventures into new fields and with new partners are steps forward to achieving Strategy 2030.

The 52nd ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji (May 2019) coincided with financing partners’ increasing interest in the Pacific region, e.g., United Kingdom’s re-engagement with the region by establishing diplomatic representation in Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu in 2018. The meeting also put a spotlight on the Pacific region’s needs and opened opportunities for stronger partnerships. In April 2019, the [Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/ireland-trust-fund-climate-change-disaster-resilience-sids) (SIDS) was established to help SIDS manage disasters caused by natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. The fund had an initial €12 million contribution from Ireland.

The same annual meeting also launched ADB’s initial foray into ocean health, the [Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies for Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/ireland-trust-fund-climate-change-disaster-resilience-sids), which aims to expand financing for ocean health and marine economy to $5 billion from 2019 to 2024. Preliminary action such as stakeholder mapping and consultations have taken place in the latter half of 2019. The year also saw gradual but consistent progress in terms of engaging with partners not so familiar with ADB. For instance, steady dialogue with JPMorgan culminated in a partnership focusing on advancing women and trade, with JPMorgan committing $1.36 million as grant.

Continued and expanded cooperation with ADB’s traditional partners comprised the bulk of 2019’s cofinancing activities. In February, ADB and Agence Francaise de Developpement amended their existing Partnership Framework Agreement to increase their cofinancing commitment from $3 billion in the past 3 years to $5 billion in the next 3 years. A month later, ADB and the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank signed their first cofinancing framework

agreement. Throughout the year, two new trust funds were established and 13 received replenishments from their donors, with the new commitments totaling $1.47 billion. Climate financing continued to be a priority and 2019 was the year ADB attained the $6 billion climate financing target it set for itself in 2016, one year ahead of its 2020 target schedule. Before the year ended, KfW expanded its existing $4 billion cofinancing commitment for 2014-2019 with another $2 billion until 2023.

### Shared Progress is Exponential

Partnerships forged under Strategy 2030 seem to be on the right track, taking a stronger focus on country ownership and paying greater attention to transparency and mutual accountability. But ADB is not taking things easy.

As the COVID-10 global pandemic unfolds, ADB’s priorities are also shifting as new areas of immediate need emerge: bolstering health systems of DMCs; setting up economic and social safeguards for the vulnerable sectors during pandemics as an element of disaster-preparedness; stimulating economies that stalled or slowed down in the pandemic; designing urban centers or island states to better withstand future shocks; strengthening regional platforms on cooperation and information-sharing, and ensuring gender equality and environmental safeguards are upheld. ADB announced a $6.5 billion initial response to this health crisis and more assistance are likely to come in the coming months.

In the Philippines, ADB forged a unique strategic partnership with several government agencies and the private sector that would provide emergency food needs of families in Metro Manila and nearby provinces affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB is also exploring partnerships with private and philanthropic entities to participate in this program to expand its depth and reach more vulnerable households for a longer time period. Progress shared can be exponential. Similar supporting interventions are underway with several of ADB’s DMCs. In Uzbekistan, ADB has approved $200,000 in grant support to immediately address medical needs. It will also give $1.53 million in grants to help finance COVID-19 responses in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Tuvalu.

More than ever, ADB’s strategic partnerships has a vital role to play in helping Asia and the Pacific recover and rebuild.
