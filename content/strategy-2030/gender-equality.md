Women make up about 50% of the population in many countries in Asia and the Pacific, but not all women share the same opportunities and societal restrictions. Despite Asia’s gains in gender equality and women’s empowerment in the past decades, inequalities still exist and, for the most part, progress has been uneven.

While women have achieved positions of leadership, there are women who still struggle against sexual harassment and domestic violence. While there are women CEOs and billionaires, there are women who find accessing financial resources for livelihood activities difficult. And these often happen with women contending with unshared childcare and household chores. In Asia’s poorer countries, maternal mortality remains high. Many women have had the benefits of quality education and healthcare, yet many young girls are also still struggling to finish secondary education. In the workplace, women earn the equivalent of only 77% of men’s wages, with huge variations across countries and industries.

ADB continues to find ways to close gender equality gaps in the region. The share of ADB operations supporting gender mainstreaming grows every year and provides momentum toward achieving Strategy 2030’s ambitious target of having at least 75% of ADB’s committed operations support gender equality by 2030.

True to this commitment, ADB and its financing partners have ramped up focus in gender equality in 2019. Of the 148 cofinanced projects approved in 2019, 125 or 84% have incorporated gender equality objectives or effective gender mainstreaming components in their design.

Some of the biggest cofinanced projects approved in 2019, expected to have far-reaching development impacts, have built-in gender action plans (GAPs) in their designs. The GAPs map women’s participation and socio-economic benefits from ADB projects. Among these projects are the $6,139 million [Philippines: Malolos-Clark Railway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52083-001/main), cofinanced with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), to improve connectivity of regions and markets in northern Philippines and connect the country’s capital to Clark International Airport; the $477.86 million [People’s Republic of China: Shandong Green Development Fund Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51194-001/main), cofinanced with [KfW Bankengruppe]({{< ref "germany.md" >}}) and [Agence Française de Développement]({{< ref "france.md" >}}), to spur climate investments to help reduce carbon emissions and directly build resilience for at least 2 million people in Shandong Province; and the $340 million [Tajikistan: Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, and 5 (Obigarm-Nurobod) Road Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52042-001/main), cofinanced with the [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]({{< ref "asian-infrastructure-investment-bank.md" >}}), the [European Bank of Reconstruction and Development]({{< ref "european-bank-reconstruction-development.md" >}}), and the [OPEC Fund for International Development]({{< ref "opec-fund-international-development.md" >}}), to improve connectivity and trade in Central Asia and provide isolated local communities with access to jobs, markets, and social services such as education and health.  

Many bilateral partners of ADB also prioritize gender equality in their development agenda, including [Australia]({{< ref "australia.md" >}}), [Canada]({{< ref "canada.md" >}}), [Denmark]({{< ref "denmark.md" >}}), [Ireland]({{< ref "ireland.md" >}}), and [Norway]({{< ref "norway.md" >}}), staunch contributors of ADB’s Gender and Development Cooperation Fund (GDCF). Established in 2003 and now in operation for over 16 years, the GDCF has supported regional technical assistance and grant-funded project components that push the gender equality agenda forward. As of 31 December 2019, the GDCF’s total committed contributions is at $12.6 million.

### Women’s Economic Empowerment

In many countries in Asia, women are still burdened by domestic and care work, which prohibit them from taking on paid skilled work or livelihood opportunities. Women are still at a disadvantage in accessing financial resources for livelihood and other paid work. In 2019, ADB tapped the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) for cofinancing of $9.5 million for the [Sri Lanka: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49273-001/main#project-overview), which aims to provide a line of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka. The project had an innovative feature of allocating loan proceeds to participating financial institutions via an auction system.

We-Fi is also providing $2.24 million for an attached technical assistance for export-oriented cluster development to develop Sri Lanka's next generation of SMEs. ADB has received a further $20.19 million from We-Fi to finance the [Women Accelerating Vibrant Enterprises in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (WAVES)](https://www.adb.org/news/new-we-fi-financing-enhance-adbs-support-women-led-smes-viet-nam-and-pacific) program, which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and development through women’s businesses and entrepreneurship.

### Gender Equality in Human Development

ADB and its partners continue to help create a gender-fair environment conducive to overall human development. The [Indonesia: Impact of Adolescent Nutrition Support on Development Outcomes](https://www.adb.org/projects/51354-001/main#project-overview), supported by a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), will develop nutrition-enhancing programs and policies targeting adolescent girls and young women. 

Advances in gender equality notwithstanding, many forms of violence against women across all ages are still reported widely in many Asian countries to this day and hinder women’s free and active participation. In 2019, the JFPR contributed $3 million for the [Mongolia: Combating Domestic Violence Against Women and Children Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51217-001/main#project-overview) that would provide a multi-disciplinary response and livelihood assistance services to domestic violence survivors. The project is expected to contribute to gender and social equality in Mongolia as laid out in the National Program on Gender Equality 2017-2021. 

### Gender Equality in Decision-Making and Leadership

In 2019, the GDCF supported the outreach of the Asia Women Leaders Program in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to provide leadership training opportunities to senior women government officials. The program aims to address significant gaps in women’s leadership in Asia and the Pacific. The Future Cities Future Women Initiatives, a GDCF-supported technical assistance, was also completed. The initiative aimed to provide innovative gender inclusive mechanisms integrated into inclusive, livable, and safe city management in three pilot cities: Bandung in Indonesia, Tbilisi in Georgia, and Mandalay in Myanmar.

JFPR also provided a $500,000 grant for the [Mongolia: Moving Gender Equality Forward through Civil Society Engagement](https://www.adb.org/projects/52314-001/main#project-overview) to help civil society organizations implement gender equality programs at national, sector, and local levels. About 15 local women’s NGOs will be selected to participate in the project’s implementation.

### Reduced Time Poverty of Women

Much of women’s time is spent on unpaid care and domestic work that in many societies are women’s burden alone. To be free of this time poverty will mean more time for more productive work and individual growth. ADB’s investments in infrastructure services such as water and sanitation, rural electrification, rural roads, clean cookstoves and biogas, and crop and food production technology can help provide women more time.

In Bangladesh, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is providing a $2 million grant for the [Bangladesh: Institutionalizing Gender Equality Practices in the Local Government Engineering Department](https://www.adb.org/projects/51319-001/main#project-overview) to strengthen the operational capacity of the Local Government Engineering Department to deliver effective gender equality results in its mandate to design and implement rural, urban, and small-scale water resources infrastructure across the country. Such results are expected to translate into women’s increased access to and benefits from infrastructure resources and social services. 

### Women’s Resilience to External Shocks

To protect women in low-income and vulnerable households against economic, food, and other crises, ADB will pursue targeted social assistance and gender-responsive public budgeting. The [Myanmar: Resilient Community Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51242-002/main#project-stories), supported by a $3 million grant from JFPR, will strengthen community resilience and reduce the food insecurity and poverty of rural people living in vulnerable areas, by building their capacity and providing resources to invest sustainably in climate- and disaster-resilient and market-oriented infrastructure and livelihoods. The project aims to boost female participation, with over 50,000 villagers, 30% of whom are women, expected to become better aware of climate change effects, while learning advanced livelihood management skills.

### Moving Forward

ADB’s financing partnerships have made substantial contributions to progress toward gender equality in 2019. ADB’s increasing attention to SDG 5's transformative gender agenda, by way of the regional technical assistance [Promoting Transformative Gender Equality Agenda in Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/projects/52214-001/main#project-overview), should guide Strategy 2030 efforts and initiatives. 

However, [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-asia-pacific) estimates that the cost of gender inequalities in Asia and the Pacific is up to $2.2 trillion.  Sustainable financing is needed if ADB and its partners are to continue their efforts to accelerate progress in gender equality in the coming decade. The Asia and Pacific region would need new and more robust strategic financing partnerships with institutions that strongly support the gender equality agenda and are keen on not letting gender equality gains slide.
