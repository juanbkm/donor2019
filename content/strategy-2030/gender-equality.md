ADB’s financing partnerships have made substantial contributions to progress toward gender equality in 2019. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, however, ADB and its partners need to safeguard gender equality gains and prepare to push the gender agenda forward after the crisis.

### Strategy 2030 and Gender Equality

Remembering the lessons from other health crises like the Ebola in 2014, the Zika in 2015-6, and the recent outbreak of SARS, swine flu, and bird flu, one can already expect the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to affect women and men differently, with women likely getting the short end of the bargain. In the short term, office women currently working from home due to the prescribed social distancing measures may find themselves being responsible for the many things on top of their actual work, from tutoring children to caring for sick family members to taking care of the home. In the long term, more dramatic effects may be felt, from job losses to loss of independence or social protection, and more.

In the Asia and Pacific region, where gender equality remains a distant reality, there is all the more reason to continue addressing gender inequalities on the ground, from access to healthcare and humanitarian aid to women’s active participation in policy and decision-making. Equally important is the need to safeguard the gains made towards gender equality, make sure that they are not eroded by the current health crisis, and lay the groundwork for moving the gender equality agenda forward in the aftermath of the pandemic.

ADB, in its Strategy 2030, considers gender equality as an operational priority and has committed to promote gender equality in at least 75% of all projects and programs. Strategy 2030, approved in 2018, sets the course for ADB’s efforts to respond effectively to the Asia and Pacific region’s changing needs. Gender equality, as one of seven operational priorities of Strategy 2030, focuses on five areas:

* women’s economic empowerment
* gender equality in human development
* gender equality in decision-making and leadership
* reduced time poverty of women
* women’s resilience to external shocks

True to its commitment, ADB has amplified progress in gender equality. In 2019, ADB approved multiple sovereign projects with gender equality measures or effective gender mainstreaming components. ADB also completed 67 gender action plans (GAPs) for new and ongoing projects.

GAPs set forth tangible and measurable indicators for ensuring women’s participation and benefits from ADB projects. Key aspects of the GAP are incorporated into project assurances to encourage buy-in from partners.

To help mobilize more resources and achieve Strategy 2030 targets, ADB is keen on building strategic financing partnerships with diverse institutions. Throughout the year, ADB and its cofinancing partners embarked on projects, programs, and activities that contributed towards accelerating progress in gender equality.

### Financing Partnerships at Work

In 2019, ADB and its financing partners cofinanced 148 projects, 125 or 84% of which have incorporated gender equality measures in their design, surpassing the 75% target of Strategy 2030. Investments on 2019 cofinanced projects with gender equality components reached a total of $4.5 billion.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), KfW, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) topped the list of ADB’s financing partners for gender equality, registering the highest cofinancing contributions in approved ADB projects. JICA is providing $2,011 million to the [Philippines: Malolos-Clark Railway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52083-001/main), while EBRD has committed $150 million to the [Tajikistan: Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, and 5 (Obigarm-Nurobod) Road Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52042-001/main). KfW, meanwhile, is cofinancing two big projects in the People’s Republic of China─the [Anhui Huangshan Xin'an River Ecological Protection and Green Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52026-001/main) and the [Shandong Green Development Fund Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51194-001/main). All these projects have built in GAPs in their designs,

Many other bilateral partners of ADB prioritize gender equality in their development agenda. A few, however, stand out. Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway have been supporting ADB’s Gender and Development Cooperation Fund (GDCF) since its establishment in 2003.

ADB’s GDCF, now in operation for over 16 years, has supported regional technical assistance and grant-funded project components that push the gender equality agenda forward. In 2019, the GDCF supported the outreach of the Asia Women Leaders Program in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to provide leadership training opportunities to senior women government officials. The program aims to address significant gaps in women’s leadership in Asia and the Pacific. Also in 2019, the Future Cities Future Women Initiatives, a GDCF-supported technical assistance, was completed. The initiative aimed to provide innovative gender inclusive mechanisms integrated into inclusive, livable, and safe city management in three pilot cities Bandung in Indonesia, Tbilisi in Georgia, and Mandalay in Myanmar.

As of 31 December 2019, the GDCF’s total committed contributions is at $12.6 million, with an uncommitted balance of $0.1 million.

### Closing the Gender Equality Gaps

Despite Asia’s gains in gender equality and women’s empowerment, inequalities still exist, and women still lack opportunities for participation and advancement in community affairs, businesses, and government. ADB and its financing partners are working on projects and programs that aim to close these gender equality gaps, focusing on the priority areas set forth in ADB’s Strategy 2030.

In many countries in Asia, women are still burdened by domestic and care work, which prohibit them from taking on paid skilled work or livelihood opportunities. In Bangladesh, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is providing a $2 million grant for the [Bangladesh: Institutionalizing Gender Equality Practices in the Local Government Engineering Department](https://www.adb.org/projects/51319-001/main#project-overview) to strengthen the operational capacity of the Local Government Engineering Department to deliver effective gender equality results in its mandate to design and implement rural, urban, and small-scale water resources infrastructure across the country. Such results are expected to translate into women’s increased access to and benefits from infrastructure resources and social services, including more time for productive work and individual growth.

Even if unburdened by unpaid domestic work, women are still at a disadvantage in accessing financial resources for livelihood and other paid work. In 2019, ADB tapped the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) for additional financing of $9.5 million to the [Sri Lanka: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49273-001/main#project-overview), which aims to provide a line of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka with an innovative feature of allocating loan proceeds to participating financial institutions via an auction system. We-Fi is also providing $2.24 million for an attached technical assistance for export-oriented cluster development to develop Sri Lanka's next generation of SMEs. ADB has received a further $20.19 million from We-Fi to finance the [Women Accelerating Vibrant Enterprises in Southeast Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/news/new-we-fi-financing-enhance-adbs-support-women-led-smes-viet-nam-and-pacific) (WAVES) program, which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and development through women’s businesses and entrepreneurship.

These advances in gender equality notwithstanding, many forms of violence against women across all ages are still reported widely in many Asian countries to this day. ADB and its partners continue to help create a gender-fair environment conducive for overall human development. In 2019, the JFPR contributed $3 million for the [Mongolia: Combating Domestic Violence Against Women and Children project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52314-001/main#project-overview) that would provide a multi-disciplinary response and livelihood assistance services to domestic violence survivors. The project is expected to contribute to gender and social equality in Mongolia as laid out in the National Program on Gender Equality 2017-2021. JFPR also provided a $500,000 grant for the [Mongolia: Moving Gender Equality Forward through Civil Society Engagement](https://www.adb.org/projects/52314-001/main#project-overview) to help civil society organizations implement gender equality programs at national, sector, and local levels.

To ensure effective delivery of its commitments, ADB approved the regional technical assistance [Promoting Transformative Gender Equality Agenda in Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/projects/52214-001/main#project-overview), with a $1.29 million contribution from JP Morgan Chase and $5.99 million from We-Fi. The project will help in the delivery of the ADB Strategy 2030 gender equality targets and adopts the transformative approach in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

### Strategic Partnerships for the Future

The longer the COVID-19 pandemic takes its toll on countries and communities, the brighter a light it shines on the remaining gender equality gaps that ADB’s Strategy 2030 aims to address. These include gender inequalities in education and healthcare, women’s continuing burden of domestic work and poverty, women’s lack of access to finance, women’s dismal representation in higher levels of government, and, rather timely, the lack of mechanisms and structures to prepare women for external shocks. The pandemic highlights the urgency of accelerating progress in gender equality to narrow these gender gaps.

ADB’s increasing attention to SDG 5's transformative gender agenda, by way of the regional technical assistance [Promoting Transformative Gender Equality Agenda in Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/projects/52214-001/main#project-overview), should guide Strategy 2030 efforts and initiatives. More investments are needed for projects that strengthen women’s resilience to disasters likely to be brought by climate change, provide women increased access to finance and livelihood opportunities, and enable a more equitable environment for women and the coming generations.

The share of ADB operations supporting gender mainstreaming grows every year and provides momentum toward achieving and sustaining Strategy 2030’s ambitious target of having at least 75% of ADB’s committed operations supportive of gender equality by 2030. However, McKinsey's estimates that the cost of gender inequalities in Asia and the Pacific is up to $2.2 trillion.1 Sustainable financing is needed if ADB and its partners are to continue their efforts to accelerate progress in gender equality in the coming decade.

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Asia and Pacific region would need new and more robust strategic financing partnerships with institutions that strongly support the gender equality agenda and are keen on not letting gender equality gains slide. The successes of 2019 offer a good start to achieving the Strategy 2030 gender target.
