On the backs of farmers lay the food needs of entire populations. In Asia and the Pacific, this means growing food for about 4 billion people—expected to reach 4.9 billion by 2030—using poor irrigation infrastructure and depleting land and water resources that are further threatened by the impacts of climate change.

Many of Asia’s farmers contend with their own poverty. Over 90% till less than two hectares of land and earn little from their harvest, due to limited access to modern agricultural technologies, financing, and markets. Together however, these smallholders contribute 80% of Asia’s food requirements. Asia’s agricultural markets are also riddled problems, from trading cartels and local monopolies, to dilapidated storage facilities and lack of cold chain and packing systems. Such inefficiencies result in a large amount of food waste, high prices of agricultural products, and compromised food safety.

Low regard for rural development across Asia aggravates agricultural problems. Weak rural-urban connectivity because of bad road networks hampers the transport of commodities. Underdeveloped irrigation infrastructure and unreliable power supply disrupts farming processes. Lack of access to education and healthcare provides additional distress to farmer families. The rural youth, already disinterested in back-breaking farm work, opt to migrate to cities to look for more lucrative opportunities.

Food security remains a problem for most countries in Asia, despite the region’s progress in reducing hunger and malnutrition. In 2017, about 518 million people remained food insecure. Shifting dietary preference, from cereals to meat, oils, fruits and vegetables, offers a new challenge to achieving food security, as do the negative impacts of climate change on production, resulting in increased food prices. According to a new [ADB report](https://www.adb.org/publications/investment-agriculture-food-security-asia-pacific-2030), however, it is possible to reduce the number of food insecure people to below 5% of the total population by 2030 by doubling annual investments in agriculture.

ADB’s Strategy 2030 considers promoting rural development and food security as an operational priority and aims to increase agricultural productivity and profitability, enhance food safety, and improve climate and environmental resilience and sustainability. Specifically, ADB will

* improve market connectivity and agricultural value chain linkages to enhance connectivity and mobility between rural and urban areas

* increase agricultural productivity and food security using high-level technologies

* enhance food safety through improved policies, standards, and institutions

### Partnerships at Work: 2019 Activities

ADB and its financing partners use a comprehensive multi-sector approach to promoting rural development and achieving food security. Work toward this Strategy 2030 operational priority includes projects and programs in agriculture, water, education, finance, health, and public sector management and directly relate to cross-cutting thematic concerns, such as climate change, disaster resilience, governance, regional cooperation, and poverty in general. Project cofinancing totaled $23.65 million in 2019.

ADB’s partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is going strong as bilateral discussions in May 2019 identified new opportunities for future collaboration, covering not only project design and cofinancing, but also knowledge management, policy engagement and joint partnerships with other development partners such as the private sector and farmers' organizations. From 2019-2021, IFAD estimates potential cofinancing of $171.5 million for Afghanistan and Pakistan; $135 million for the People’s Republic of China and Mongolia; $423.3 million for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka; and $195 million for Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Myanmar, The Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

In 2019, IFAD approved a $40 million grant for the [Afghanistan: Arghandab Integrated Water Resources Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/48096-002/main), which will, in general improve the availability and management of water resources in the Arghandab basin in Kandahar province. Among its relevant expected outcomes are increased reliability of irrigation water supplies downstream of the Dahla dam and improved agriculture water productivity by providing on-farm support to farmers to improve crop production.

ADB’s Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) continues its good work in providing additional financial and knowledge resources to deliver more productive and efficient irrigation and drainage services (alongside sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation and reduced risks to floods). ADB established the WFPF in 2006 as an umbrella fund for mobilizing financial and knowledge resources from donor partners to facilitate increased investments in the water sector. The fund has contributions from Australia, Austria, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. As of December 2019, committed contributions to the WFPF has reached $116.4 million.

The WFPF-supported [Indonesia: Integrated Participatory Development and Management of Irrigation Program](https://www.adb.org/projects/43220-014/main) was also completed in 2019. WFPF funding enabled the introduction of LIDAR (light detection and ranging) surveys for operations and maintenance of irrigation networks. The precision of this high-level technology allows the easy identification of irrigation infrastructure that need utmost rehabilitation. About 6,000 hectares of irrigation area were covered by the WFPF-funded LIDAR pilot survey.

In 2019, the WFPF contributed to the preparation of the [People’s Republic of China: Yangtze River Green Ecological Corridor Comprehensive Agriculture Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51116-002/main), which will strengthen rural livelihoods, modernize agriculture production systems, and minimize environmental degradation. It also financed the [Bangladesh: Preparing the Climate and Disaster Resilient Small-Scale Water Resources Management Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/53237-002/main), a feasibility study to enhance government readiness for a project that will improve agricultural productivity and profitability through sustainable small-scale water resources management.

ADB organized the [Rural Development and Food Security Forum 2019](https://www.adb.org/news/events/rural-development-and-food-security-forum-2019), the only event globally that discussed development of rural areas as a driving force to food security. ADB’s partners in mounting the forum were the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Food Policy Research Institute, International Fund for Agricultural Development, International Rice Research Institute, World Bank, WorldFish, World Food Programme, and the World Vegetable Centre. With the theme “Transformative Changes for Rural Prosperity and Nutritious Food,” the forum called upon ADB developing member countries to prioritize agricultural development and rural prosperity in their national agenda and invited development partners to share knowledge and solutions to achieve food security in the region.

ADB and its financing partners began work this year on several innovative projects to address the broad gaps in rural development and food security, foremostly on the application of modern technologies in agriculture and improving agricultural markets and connectivity. More stringent work is expected in the coming years to achieve the Strategy 2030 operational priority.

To increase agricultural productivity and food security using high-level technologies, ADB approved the [Regional: Digital Solutions to Improve Agricultural Value Chains project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49054-001/main). With $500,000 financing each from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and the High Level Technology Fund, the project is testing the use of information and communication technologies in agriculture in increasing productivity, efficiency, and profitability of stakeholders along value chains. This eAgriculture system is being implemented in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam.

The High Level Technology Fund is also providing a $1.6 million grant to the [Cambodia: Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51159-002/main), which will modernize and climate-proof irrigation systems and improve farming practices and promote crop diversification. The grant will help establish a water resources management data center to improve data use on in better water resources planning, management, and investment.

The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction provided $2 million for the [Pakistan: Enhancing Technology-Based Agriculture and Marketing in Rural Punjab project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52232-001/main), which will facilitate the rapid adoption of advanced technologies to improve the productivity and profitability of the agriculture sector in Punjab Province, Pakistan. It will help increase farmers' access to such technologies to strengthen agriculture value chains in rural Punjab. It will also enable further development and adoption of advanced technologies to benefit the agriculture sector.

To improve agricultural value chains in Pakistan, the Agence Française de Développement, through the Cooperation Fund for Project Preparation in the Greater Mekong Subregion and in Other Specific Asian Countries, is providing $200,000 for the [Pakistan: Preparing the Punjab Agriculture Markets Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/53070-002/main). The project will finance the development of a modern holistic wholesale agriculture market in Lahore and prepare a master plan for development of wholesale markets in other locations.

In Cambodia, the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund is contributing $150,000 as additional financing for the [Cambodia: Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/41435-053/main). The additional financing will enhance agricultural productivity and improve access to markets in target communes through investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, building capacity in disaster risk management of the communities, and creating an enabling environment for agricultural productivity, diversification, and climate resilience.

### Strategic Partnerships for the Future

ADB’s existing financing partnerships keen on fast-tracking agriculture sector development are collaborating on projects and programs to further increase agricultural productivity and food security by boosting farm and nonfarm incomes to also uplift the lives of Asia’s poor rural farmers. Specifically, they are focused on improving market connectivity and [agricultural value chain linkages](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/much-asia-still-goes-bed-unfed) and promoting the adoption of [climate-smart farming technologies](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/much-asia-still-goes-bed-unfed).

As the current COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, the immediate effects of the crisis on rural development and food security are increasingly becoming apparent. Panic purchases, transport interruptions, and limited access to markets are breaking supply chains and causing localized price hikes or result in food loss and waste. Asia’s farmers, as among the worst affected, are now even more vulnerable and would need social protection to cushion the shocks and combat both existing and new poverty. The long-term impacts of the pandemic are still difficult to assess.

In 2019, ADB published the report, “[Ending Hunger in Asia and the Pacific by 2030: An Assessment of Investment Requirements in Agriculture](https://www.adb.org/publications/investment-agriculture-food-security-asia-pacific-2030),” which proposes to double investments in agricultural research and development, improvement of water management, and infrastructure to reduce marketing costs and postharvest losses. Such large investment, the report said, will help end hunger and malnutrition and achieve food security in the region by 2030. Post-pandemic, however, it will certainly cost Asia so much more.

Now, more than ever, ADB will need to forge new strategic financing partnerships with a heightened sense of urgency to [protect food security](https://blogs.adb.org/amid-COVID19-time-act-now-protect-food-security) in Asia. This, while planning and preparing for the more challenging impacts the COVID-19 pandemic will bring to farmers, the agriculture sector, and rural communities in the long run.
