### Strategy 2030 and strengthening government systems through partnerships 

The Asia and the Pacific makes for an excellent argument for ADB's continued and unyielding efforts to achieve strong governance. Here is why: nearly 80% of the region's population lives in developing member countries (DMCs) with widening inequality, and more than 264 million in the region live in extreme poverty.  

ADB's work with its DMCs and partners find fertile grounds for sustainable up-scaling and out-scaling if fostered in stable and corruption-free local conditions. ADB's DMCs, however, are confronted with deep-seated governance issues, including poor public services, and weak government institutions and capacity. All these allow corruption to remain pervasive, costing the world $3.6 trillion every year. These are resources meant for the poor - gone into private interests.  

Despite showing signs of better governance and institutional capacities, problems persist in some countries in Asia and the Pacific. The Worldwide Governance Indicators, a data set of perception-based relative governance performance, developing Asia and the Pacific continues to lag other regions. ADB's vision of Strategy 2030 requires effective governance and improved institutional capacity in its DMCs.  

ADB is aligning its aspirations for Asia and the Pacific with the global commitments of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ADB's Strategy 2030 sets a new course by refocusing its operations and approaches on ensuring ADB is on top of and responding to the region's rapidly evolving development needs. ADB's essential modalities for strengthened governance and institutional capacity are technical assistance (TA), policy-based operations, and results-based lending (RBL). To do this, ADB sets out expected operational outcomes on these areas:  

* Governance and institutional capacity for service delivery 
* Public sector management and financial stability 

### Financing Partnerships at Work 

Governance covers a wide array of sectors and thematic groups contributing to ADB's governance operations plan. These are education, energy, finance, health, transport, urban, water, climate change and disaster risk management, gender, social development, rural development and food security, regional cooperation, and public-private partnership. In 2019, ADB approved 126 cofinanced projects promoting its governance agenda and cutting across different sectors and themes. These projects amounted to a total of $4,252.26 million in donor contributions. 

The top cofinancier who contributed to governance-related projects were Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) with $2,353.73 million, followed by KfW Bankengruppe (KfW) for $553.7 million, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with $300 million, New Development Bank (NDB) with 260 million, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with 200 million.  

The sectors with highest governance-related projects were transport, followed by public sector management, energy, water and urban infrastructure services, and health. The top DMCs with most governance-related projects in 2019 were the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Uzbekistan. 

Strategy 2030 emphasizes ADB's efforts to attract additional financing to address priority governance and institutional issues. Specialized governance trust funds like the multi-donor Governance Cooperation Fund. The fund, established in 2001 with a grant from the Government of Canada, is an umbrella facility to support government-led governance reforms aimed at improving transparency, accountability, predictability, and participation. Since then, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway have made contributions to support the fund. 

Strategy 2030 also puts importance on knowledge-based partnerships to maximize development impact for clients. ADB taps regional and global expertise, which meant forming alliances with international financial institutions, bilateral development partners, research and academic institutions, philanthropic organizations, CSOs, and the private sector. 

Examples of these partnerships are The ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia, and the Pacific launched in 1999, The Open Government Partnership launched in 2011, The Development Partners Network on Decentralisation and Local Governance launched in 2006, and the  OECD Development Assistance Committee Network on Governance (GovNet) launched in 1995 to whom ADB joined in 2001. 

### Closing the Gap: 2019 projects   

In 2019 was a good year for governance in ADB's cofinancing operations. Eighty-five percent of all cofinancing projects during the year contributed to advancing the Strategy 2030 governance agenda. 

ADB's work governance and institutional capacity help governments operate equitably and efficiently, as well as improve the delivery of their services to the public. Covering the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the [Connecting the Railways of the Greater Mekong Subregion (Phase 2)](https://www.adb.org/projects/42518-025/main#project-pds), a regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA), is cofinanced by the People's Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund for $ 500,000.00. The TA supports the Greater Mekong Railway Association (GMRA) by improving the organizational structure of the GMRA, preparing an operational readiness plan, and updating the GMS railway strategy for the development of missing cross-border railway links and associated domestic connections. The TA runs from 2019-2021. 

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is cofinancing the [Georgia: North–South Corridor (Kvesheti–Kobi) Road Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51257-001/main#project-pds) for $60.00 million. The project, which runs from 2019 to 2026, aims to improve connectivity and safety along the North-South Corridor by constructing about 23 kilometers (km) of climate-resilient two-lane highway between Kvesheti and Kobi (the project road) and about 5 km of all-weather access roads. The project will also help increase road safety awareness and improve the capacity of the Roads Department on project and contract management. The project expands efforts of ADB and other development partners to upgrade the country's national highway network along vital economic corridors.  

The Uzbekistan project, [Power Generation Efficiency Improvement Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/49253-003/main#project-pds), is cofinanced by the Uzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development for $177.00 million, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for $240.00 million, and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for $2.00 million. The project, which runs from 2019 to 2023, is constructing two units of 450 MW energy-efficient gas turbines at the Talimarjan Thermal Power Plant in the Kashkadarya region. It aims to contribute to energy saving, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and reliable power supply in Uzbekistan. The project builds on the experience gained through the Talimarjan Power Project, which helped improved corporate governance in the energy sector. 

The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and the People's Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund are cofinancing a knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) in Mongolia for $0.5 million each. The [Methane Gas Supply Chain Development Master Plan](https://www.adb.org/projects/51285-001/main#project-pds) will support the study on the development of the country's first nationwide methane gas supply infrastructure development strategy. The TA will help the country's policy (i) to mitigate air pollution in Mongolia, and (ii) to ensure the reliable, cleaner, and secured primary energy supply, by developing a methane gas supply infrastructure development strategy paper to switch primary energy resource from coal to cleaner methane gas. The study will run from 2019-2022.  

The public sector management aspect of this operational priority focuses on improving public expenditure and fiscal management, reforms of state-owned enterprises, and social protection. 

In Pakistan, the [Energy Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program (Subprogram 1)](https://www.adb.org/projects/53165-001/main#project-pds) is cofinanced by the Export-Import Bank of Korea for $ 80.00 million. The project aims to address fiscal, governance, technical, and policy deficits in Pakistan's energy sector. These deficits have adversely impacted the sector's quality and efficiency of services, and the sustainability of energy infrastructure and finances, thereby challenging Pakistan's fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability. The project runs from 2019-2020.  

In the Philippines, the [Strengthening the Transition of Vulnerable Communities Affected by the Malolos-Clark Railway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52083-007/main#project-pds), cofinanced by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for $2.00 million was approved. The TA will involve consultations with project affected persons (PAPs) for the preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Livelihood Restoration and Improvement Program (LRIP) for the Malolos-Clark Railway Project. The TA runs from 2019-2021. 

Cofinanced by KfW for $553.70 million, the [Fiscal and Public Expenditure Management Program (Subprogram 3)](https://www.adb.org/projects/50168-003/main#project-pds) in Indonesia supports critical fiscal and public expenditure management reforms to improve the quality of government spending on health, education, social protection, and infrastructure. The subprogram runs from 2019 to 2020. In Tonga, the [Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program, Subprogram 3](https://www.adb.org/projects/48361-003/main#project-pds) is cofinanced by the Government of Australia for $2.80 million, the European Union for $2.20 million, and the World Bank for $5.50 million. The program, consisting of three subprograms, aims to strengthen Tonga's long-term growth prospects and capacity to respond to external shocks. It supports government efforts to improve the country's its fiscal position by adopting prudent policies and better public financial management and improve the business climate by continuing policy, regulatory, and public enterprise reforms. The project ran from June to October 2019.  

Similarly, in Tuvalu, the [Improved Fiscal and Infrastructure Management Program](https://www.adb.org/projects/50377-001/main#project-pds) is cofinanced by the Government of Australia for $1.00 million, the European Union for $1.50 million, the World Bank for $7.50 million, and the Government of New Zealand for $ 0.6 million. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA), which ran from October to December 2019, helped implement and sustain the government's medium-term public sector management reform agenda by supporting efforts to improve public financial management practices and public service delivery. The Government of Tuvalu recognizes that improved macroeconomic sustainability and public service delivery is critical, given the development challenges that it faces. 

### Strategic Partnerships and the Future 

Public financial systems are being put to the test as governments undergo unprecedented realignment of resources to respond to the COVID19 pandemic, currently unfolding all over the world. Health departments, the academe, research and development, agriculture, trade and industry, law enforcement, and legislature—all find themselves in a high-pressure situation where intensive and efficient coordination is required. Well-oiled governance machines shine in these times. Those that are not, are forced to shape up overnight.  

ADB's [response](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/covid19-coronavirus) to the fast-evolving needs of its DMCs had been quick, and partnerships will help ADB and its DMCs do much more. 

An important area of partnership, which promotes transparency and efficiency in public financial systems, is to improve the capacities of institutions in collecting and reporting accurate statistics. This will help strengthen the monitoring of governance efforts and other development initiatives, especially with the vast amounts of monetary resources being allotted toward responding to the pandemic. 

Several areas of potential partnership can also be gleaned as vulnerable populations are confronted with the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic. First off, the development sector—led by ADB and its partners—should underscore the need for government systems enabling more reliable social protection. The crisis highlights the need to strengthen programs and policies affecting the poor and the elderly and their family members. Millions of people already find it challenging to get by daily before the crisis find themselves in an impossible position now. As businesses close, roads are blocked, and mobility is minimal, these people are being pushed further down into poverty.  

Stop-gap and rapid response social assistance may be the difference between life and death for them. ADB and its partners have a tremendous opportunity to contribute to social equity by working together on these rapid response measures.  
Banks and other financing institutions are also finding themselves in a volatile situation, with loans and debts in danger of falling into default. Micro, small, and medium enterprises are also at risk. To prevent financial instability, ADB's partnerships may find ways to provide financial relief for indebted households and small businesses and help stimulate the economy through fitting and proper fiscal policy response.
