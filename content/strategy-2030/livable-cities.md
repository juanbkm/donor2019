### Strategy 2030 and Making Cities Livable

Globally, more than half of the world's population live in urban areas. The Asia-Pacific is home to 44% of the world's urban population. Nowhere else is the unprecedented economic transformation that the region underwent in the past two decades better manifested than in the proliferation of its cities.

This transformation is set to intensify as it was projected in 2019 that the region would be responsible for [90% of the 2.4 billion new members of the middle class](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/asia-economic-growth/) entering the global economy. One characteristic of the middle class is that it is [disproportionately urban](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27726/special-chapter-03.pdf) in most countries.

ADB's goal is to help its developing member countries (DMCs) transform their congested, polluted, and inequitable cities into livable ones—competitive, equitable, environment-friendly, disaster-resilient, and efficient in its services. Concrete steps toward this goal were set out in the Bank's Strategy 2030.

ADB agenda on livable cities is laid out in its Strategy 2030. The plan is anchored on two overarching approaches: i) transformative opportunity, and ii) making city-level plans reflect global agenda. Specifically, these approaches are helping ADB and cities in the DMCs adopt a holistic approach to achieve livable cities with the following strategic areas:

* improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and reliability of services in urban areas to make them energy-efficient, gender-responsive, inclusive, and sustainable by supporting integrated development, building capacities, and promoting high-level technologies;

* strengthen urban planning and financial sustainability of cities by promoting inclusive and participatory processes and supporting cities to develop and efficiently use their financial resources; and

* improve urban environments, climate resilience, and disaster management through, for example, enhancing resources and building capacity.

### Financing Partnerships at Work

Partnerships in financing are expanding ADB’s reach and impact. The livable cities agenda covers the project in the following fields: water and urban sanitation, transport for urban services, climate change and disaster resilience, and urban and financial planning. In 2019, 25 cofinanced projects were approved for water and urban sanitation amounting to $171.5 million. Another 17 cofinanced projects on transport were approved, totaling $2.74 billion. Of these, XX focused on urban services. Climate financing reached $6.37 billion in 2019, $705 million coming from financing partners. Of these, XX projects focused on climate change and disaster resilience, amounting to $xx million.

In the past decade, the Urban Financing Partnership Facility (UFPF) has been an essential vehicle for ADB's partners to advance their shared vision of livable urban centers with ADB. By 2019, the facility had a total of $191.86 million, with its largest share coming from the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) at 78%.

In April 2019, ADB approved the establishment of a fourth trust fund under the UFPF, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund (AASCTF). AASCTF is a single-partner trust fund with an indicative contribution from the Government of Australia totaling A$20 million ($15.24 million). The trust fund focuses on building livable cities that are green, competitive, inclusive, and resilient. All DMCs in Southeast Asia are eligible for the fund. Water services are a critical component of a livable city. The Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) was established in 2006 to provide additional financial and knowledge resources from development partners. By 2019, partner contributions following the additional contributions from the Government of Australia (A$1.0 million) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($3.0 million) reached $116.401 million. In 2019, a total of $9.7 million was allocated to 21 projects. Half of this amount went to projects on water supply, sanitation, and wastewater management, with a total of $4.83 million. The second biggest subsector with approved projects was on irrigation and drainage with $1.70 million.

### Closing the Gap: 2019 projects

In 2019, cofinanced projects aiming to improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and reliability of services in urban areas were approved. In India, the New Development Bank is cofinancing the Mumbai Metro Rail Systems for $260 million to help contribute to the development of a modern and safe rail-based urban transit system in Mumbai city, which will reduce pollution and traffic congestion, increase public transport ridership, and improve the overall quality of the city's transport system. The project runs from 2019 to 2023.

Over in Mongolia, the Green Climate Fund is contributing $95 million to the Ulaanbaatar Green Affordable Housing and Resilient Urban Renewal Sector. The project, which runs from 2019-2027, will deliver sustainable and comprehensive solutions to transform the substandard, climate-vulnerable, and heavily polluting ger areas of Ulaanbaatar city into affordable, low carbon, climate-resilient, and livable eco-districts. ADB’s cofinancing partners also helped prepare big investment projects to ensure their proper implementation like this technical assistance in Uzbekistan, which the People's Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation gave $1 million for, on [preparing for urban development and improvement projects](https://www.adb.org/projects/52317-001/main#project-pds). The technical assistance runs from 2019-2023.

Collaborations aiming to strengthen urban planning and financial sustainability of cities by promoting inclusive and participatory processes were approved. In Pakistan, the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility provided a grant of $2 million as [project readiness financing for the preparation and engineering design of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cities Improvement Project (KPCIP)](https://www.adb.org/projects/51036-003/main#project-pds). The grant will ensure the timely and cost-effective achievement of the project outcomes and will run from 2019 to 2024. The KPCIP will improve the quality of life of the residents of at least four cities, including Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, and Peshawar, directly benefitting about 3.5 million of the urban population.

Improving climate resilience and disaster management for urban environments were advanced as projects in 2019 were approved. The World Bank and the Green Climate Fund are cofinancing a project seeking to [improve the water supply in Kiribati's South Tarawa](https://www.adb.org/projects/49453-002/main#project-pds), for $12.96 million and $28.63 million, respectively. The project addresses factors that result in the high incidence of waterborne disease in South Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati. This is done through the delivery and effective management of new and rehabilitated climate-resilient water supply assets, as well as improved hygiene practices. Among others, a significant target output of the project is a climate-resilient and low carbon water supply infrastructure. This will be achieved by building a desalination plant of 4,000 cubic meters per day, whose energy consumption is offset by a 2,500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system. The project will run from 2019 to 2027.

Also, in 2019, a regional knowledge and support technical assistance co-funded by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) for $ 1 million was signed. The project supports the [establishment of a Platform for Climate Resilient and Low Carbon Urban Development](https://www.adb.org/projects/52304-001/main#project-pds). It aims to establish a collaborative process among key stakeholders at ADB and the DMCs, which will result in the production of a knowledge base on climate-informed urban development. It will run from 2019 to 2022.

Several ongoing projects also gained significant milestones in 2019. In Myanmar, UCCRTF allocated a direct charge for the Improved Urban Infrastructure Planning for Yangon. This helped the city to conduct a water balance study considering climate change impacts.

In Pakistan, the Cities Development Initiative for Asia Trust Fund completed a project preparation study linked to the ADB-financed [Punjab Intermediate Cities Improvement Investment Program (Phase 2)](https://www.adb.org/projects/51215-002/main#project-pds), which has resulted in potential investment projects for four cities in the province.

In Bangladesh, the WFPF financed a technical assistance for $0.75 million to prepare the [Climate and Disaster Resilient Small-Scale Water Resources Management Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/53237-002/main#project-pds). The project, approved in 2019 and running until 2020, is expected to help about 95 districts by improving the living conditions in the area, minimizing the impacts of floods and droughts, and increasing people's incomes.

### Strategic Partnerships and the Future

As the new reality with the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) unfolds, cities are clearly at the forefront not just in terms of response but also in terms of long-term adjustments. Statistics show the convergence of COVID-19 cases in urban centers worldwide. Global responses to stop the spread of the virus, from restricting travel to fortifying public transport to setting up better healthcare systems to promoting telecommuting, are likely to have long-term impacts on city living. Interventions to strengthen the financial sustainability of cities would be in greater need as cities recover from the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic. The cities and other urban areas—especially urban slums— are potential hot zones for a communicable disease like the COVID19, where dwellers are cramped and have hardly spaces between their homes, let alone space for preventive measures like social distancing. Urban planning initiatives need to step up to better prepare cities for future crises, health or otherwise. So would putting attention into rural roads as part of the overall urban-rural infrastructure design, ensuring unhampered movement of goods and services from rural to urban areas, and vice-versa.

In the area of the environment, the travel restrictions and a slowing down of economic activities have resulted in an initial drop in carbon emissions in many parts of the globe. But history has shown that this is likely to be temporary; that this will become an issue again once travel resumes or factories recover. The need to focus on urban air pollution, water scarcity, and natural resource degradation, and biodiversity loss remain. Moreover, the DMCs may be given more assistance in incorporating sustainable environmental goals into their national development plans, especially those with challenging city planning issues.

ADB has been [responding fast](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/covid19-coronavirus) to assist its DMCs dealing with the COVID-19 fallout. Short to long term responses may require ADB and its partners to ramp up their partnerships, which ADB [has done](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-president-strengthens-collaboration-uk-dfid-its-response-covid-19) with some of its bilateral partners. There is an opportunity for ADB and its partners to put more focus on

public health and pandemic preparedness into disaster-resilience programs and urban planning for livable cities.

In the next years, partners have pledged more support for the urban financing facility. For the UFPF, additional support is expected toward making cities more livable from the latest trust fund to join UFPF, the ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund. In November 2019, during the ADB's consultation with donors, UFPF got a commitment from the Government of the UK to provide additional financing for Phase 2 of UCCRTF. The indicative funding replenishment committed by the UK Government is about $100 million (£75million) over seven years from April 2021 to March 2028.
