Dealing with the effects of climate change is our new normal. For the past 20 years, 5.2 billion people in Asia and the Pacific have been affected by disasters such as floods, storms, droughts, earthquakes, and extreme temperatures. Worst, one million individuals have died. Disasters have also caused almost $850 billion in total direct physical [losses to the region](https://www.adb.org/news/infographics/climate-change-and-disasters-asia-and-pacific). Recent estimates reveal that the region already experiences average daily losses of $200  million because of disasters, and climate change is worsening [this](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/358881/ccof-2017-2030.pdf).  

Seven out of ten countries with the highest estimated disaster risks in the world are in [Asia and the Pacific](https://www.adb.org/news/infographics/climate-change-and-disasters-asia-and-pacific): Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu are among the small island developing states (SIDS) that are even more particularly vulnerable to climate change and disaster related shocks.

Tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and pursuing environmental stability is an operational priority in ADB’s Strategy 2030.

In 2019, ADB mobilized a total of $7 billion in total climate finance, with $5.50 billion (78%) expected to contribute to mitigating climate change and $1.5 billion (22%) to adaptation. ADB’s own resources provided $6.37 billion while external resources contributed $0.70 billion. ADB’s commitment as of 2019 even surpassed the $6 billion target it set for itself for 2020. Of the $0.70 billion from bilateral and multilateral partners, $402 million were in the form of grants.

ADB has consistently offered innovative cofinancing opportunities to partners, such as the Green Climate Fund, which supported nine projects with  [$473 million in grants and concessional financing in 2019](https://www.adb.org/news/op-ed/banking-action-how-adb-achieved-2020-climate-finance-milestone-one-year-ahead-time).  Other funds that prioritize climate change dimensions include, among others, the Asia Pacific Climate Finance Fund, Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia, Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, Climate Investment Fund, Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund, Integrated Disaster Risk Management Fund, Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism, and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund.

### Accelerating Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development

Greenhouse gas emissions will increase as rapid urbanization progresses in many parts of Asia. This will heighten the need to promote energy efficiency, as it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, ADB and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched a [partnership](https://www.adb.org/news/usaid-adb-partner-expand-asia-and-pacifics-sustainable-energy-market) to boost the capacity of clean energy systems by 6 gigawatts while increasing regional energy trade by 10% over the next five years.  

Technologies that reduce emissions while making people more resilient to climate change will be critical in the coming years. In 2019, ADB, the Clean Energy Fund, and the Climate Change Fund joined hands to initiate a sustainable energy project in Uzbekistan, a country struggling with high power demand. The [Sustainable Hydropower Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/50130-002/main#project-pds), which runs from 2019 to 2024, brings hope to other energy-intensive states looking for ways to diversify their energy mix to reduce emissions and ensure power supply is climate-proofed. It modernizes while diversifying Uzbekistan’s power generation using renewable energy.

### Ensuring a Comprehensive Approach to Building Climate and Disaster Resilience

ADB’s climate finance also looked at investments that reduce the disaster risks that countries and their  population face, such as the [National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF)](https://www.adb.org/projects/50316-002/main#project-pds) in Pakistan. The project provides financial and technical support to the NDRMF, which will function as a corporatized financial intermediary designed to reduce the country and its people’s vulnerability to natural hazards. It will finance up to 70% the cost of projects that prioritize the country’s resilience to climate change.

This can be complemented by projects such as the [Resilient Community Development](https://www.adb.org/projects/51242-002/main#project-pds),  which target sites vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks while reducing people’s food insecurity and poverty by providing them with resources for climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure and livelihoods. This type of initiatives should be prioritized in small island developing nations (SIDS), as they face the most risk to natural hazards and climate change effects. A new partnership established in 2019, the new [Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-ireland-establish-fund-boost-climate-disaster-resilience-pacific), can help in this regard. It aims to improve SIDS’s preparedness and resilience to the effects of climate change.

### Ensuring Environmental Sustainability

[Strategy 2030’s](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/495961/strategy-2030-op3-climate-change-resilience-sustainability.pdf) approach to ensuring environmental sustainability promotes shifting to sustainable infrastructure and low carbon development, building climate resilience by investing in natural capital, and improving environmental governance and management capacity.

{{< dr-artimage src="images/cli-2-vie-gen.jpg" align="left" alt="" caption="Cities should be green and climate resilient even with rapid urbanization" >}}

In 2019, ADB approved the [Mainstreaming Climate Resilience and Environmental Protection for Secondary Green Cities Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/47274-003/main#project-pds). This aims to demonstrate how cities can be green and climate resilient even while being economically competitive. This project, with the support of the Global Environment Facility Grant and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, is planting the seeds for a nationwide green secondary city development in Viet Nam. This type of project is critical for the region. Asia’s urbanization rate is accelerating quickly, and may well [reach above 64% by 2050](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/524596/ado2019-update-theme-chapter.pdf) if not managed well, worsening the effects of climate change.

The establishment of the [ASEAN Green Catalytic Climate Fund (ACGF)](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/funds/asean-catalytic-green-finance-facility/main) in 2019 will aid the work of ensuring environmental sustainability in Asia. Through the partnership of the [European Union]({{< ref "european-union.md" >}}) and the ASEAN, the ACGF will provide loans to finance climate-friendly infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia.

### Increasing Focus on the Water-Food-Energy Security Nexus

{{< dr-artimage src="images/cli-3-cam-generic.jpg" align="right" alt="" caption="No response to climate change will be effective without recognizing its connection to energy, water, and food security" >}}

No response to climate change will be effective without recognizing its connection to water, energy, and food security. Projects should be designed to address not just climate change, but the increased demand for food and water, as well as energy. Policies and projects need to prioritize the rational and proper management and allocation of water across sectors while keeping an eye out for environmental stability. One project that demonstrates this integrated approach is the [Viet Nam: Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought Affected Provinces](https://www.adb.org/projects/49404-001/main), which combines technology and water use efficiency to ensure farmers’ productivity and resilience amid widespread drought.

Another project, the [Cambodia: Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51159-001/main#project-pds), demonstrates how to address low agricultural productivity through responses that recognize the connection of water, and food security to climate change. This project is helping improve farmers’ harvest in Cambodia by making its irrigation systems efficient and climate resilient while promoting proper water resource management.

### Moving Forward

The need for increased climate finance becomes greater with each passing day. Given the rising toll of disasters, resilience remains a priority. ADB will continue to work on measures that prevent extreme disasters and reduce risks, among them better natural resource management, climate-proofed infrastructure, and better access to credit and insurance. Transitioning to renewable energy while promoting energy efficiency is also a key area for countries to address. [Multilateral development banks](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/41117/climate-change-finance-joint-mdb-statement-2019-09-23.pdf), ADB included, have been leading the way in this field, and partnerships could further scale up their initiatives. Partnerships, in a nutshell, can mitigate climate change concerns while introducing innovations that can make the marginalized and vulnerable become more resilient.
