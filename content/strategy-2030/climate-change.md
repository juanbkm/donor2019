Dealing with the effects of climate change is our new normal. For the past 20 years, 5.2 million people in Asia and the Pacific have been affected by disasters such as floods, storms, droughts, earthquakes, and extreme temperatures. Worst, one million individuals have died. Disasters have also caused US$843.6 billion total direct physical [losses to the region](https://www.adb.org/news/infographics/climate-change-and-disasters-asia-and-pacific). Recent estimates reveal that the region already experiences average daily losses of $200 million because of disasters, and climate change is worsening [this](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/358881/ccof-2017-2030.pdf).

Seven out of ten countries with the highest estimated disaster risks are in the [region](https://www.adb.org/news/infographics/climate-change-and-disasters-asia-and-pacific): Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu are among the small island developing states (SIDS) that are even more particularly vulnerable to climate change and disaster related shocks.

Tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and pursuing environmental stability is an operational priority in [ADB’s Strategy 2030](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/197301/adb-climate-change-flyer.pdf). Between [2011 to 2018](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/495961/strategy-2030-op3-climate-change-resilience-sustainability.pdf), ADB has provided more than $29 billion climate change finance for mitigation and adaptation. Under Strategy 2030, it allotted $7 billion more in [2019](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/197301/adb-climate-change-flyer.pdf). ADB plans to invest more in the coming years. In fact, for 2019 to 2030, ADB has committed $80 billion to fight climate change. It has also pledged at least 75% of its committed operations to support climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030. This is an ambitious goal, but partnerships can help ADB achieve it effectively, efficiently, and quickly.

### Financing Partnerships at Work

By 2030, it would take about $140 billion to $175 billion to cover the necessary investments to mitigate climate change in developing countries. To help countries adapt to it, Asia and the Pacific needs about $40 billion a year beginning now to [2050](https://www.adb.org/themes/climate-change-disaster-risk-management/issues/climate-financing). Alone, no organization can meet this need.

ADB’s climate finance in the past 20 years was strengthened by partnerships. In 2019, $705 million of its over $6.37 billion climate finance came from external sources. More than half of these were in the form of grants, which reached $402.3 million. These external sources include bilateral partners and multilateral funds.

These partnerships have helped ADB surpass its 2020 target a year earlier. Its climate finance in 2019 was twice as much as that in [2014](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-meets-commitment-double-annual-climate-financing-6-billion), and reached the $6 billion climate finance commitment it pledged during the launching of the Sustainable Development Goals one year ahead of its 2020 schedule. Former President Takehiko Nakao credits this achievement to ADB’s focus on integrating climate finance into all its operations and on innovative cofinancing opportunities with partners, such as the Green Climate Fund, which supported nine projects worth a total of [$473 million in grants and concessional financing in 2019](https://www.adb.org/news/op-ed/banking-action-how-adb-achieved-2020-climate-finance-milestone-one-year-ahead-time).

External sources have boosted ADB’s climate investments in 2019. These resources include support from bilateral sources and multilateral funds and ADB-managed trust funds. They include, among others, the Asia Pacific Climate Finance Fund, Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia, Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, Climate Investment Fund, Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund, Integrated Disaster Risk Management Fund, Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism, and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF). As of December 2019, their total commitments to ADB have reached over [$2.9 billion](https://www.adb.org/themes/climate-change-disaster-risk-management/funds-facilities). In addition, two more funds focused on mitigating climate change were launched in 2019, the [ASEAN Green Catalytic Climate Fund](https://www.adb.org/what-we-do/funds/asean-catalytic-green-finance-facility/main) and the [New Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States](https://www.adb.org/news/adb-ireland-establish-fund-boost-climate-disaster-resilience-pacific). ADB and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also launched in 2019 a [partnership](https://www.adb.org/news/usaid-adb-partner-expand-asia-and-pacifics-sustainable-energy-market) to promote energy efficiency, energy sector reform, and good governance.

### Closing the Climate Change Gaps

ADB financing partnerships tackling climate change have helped DMCs confront climate change with renewed zest and vigor. In 2019, ADB approved the [Mainstreaming Climate Resilience and Environmental Protection for Secondary Green Cities Development](https://www.adb.org/projects/47274-003/main#project-pds), that aim to demonstrate how cities can be green and climate resilient even while being economically competitive. This project, with the support of the Global Environment Facility Grant and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, is planting the seeds for a nationwide green secondary city development in Viet Nam. This type of project is critical for the region. Asia’s urbanization rate is accelerating quickly, and may well reach above [64% by 2050](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/524596/ado2019-update-theme-chapter.pdf), worsening the effects of climate change.

Technologies that reduce emissions while making people more resilient to climate change will be critical in the coming years. In 2019, ADB, the Clean Energy Fund, and the Climate Change Fund joined hands to initiate a sustainable energy project in Uzbekistan, a country struggling with high power demand. [The Sustainable Hydropower Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/50130-002/main#project-pds) brings hope to other energy-intensive states looking for ways to diversify their energy mix to reduce emissions and ensure power supply is climate-proofed. It modernizes while diversifying Uzbekistan’s power generation using renewable energy.

ADB’s climate finance also looked at investments that reduce the disaster risks that countries and their population face, such as the [National Disaster Risk Management Fund](https://www.adb.org/projects/50316-002/main#project-pds) in Pakistan. Projects like this not only ensure people’s resilience to future disasters, but can also help the sustainability of key government institutions and industries. This can be complemented by projects such as the [Resilient Community Development Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51242-002/main#project-pds), which target sites vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks while reducing people’s food insecurity and poverty by providing them with resources for climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure and livelihoods.

### Strategic Partnerships for the Future

The work on climate change mitigation and adaptation continues. Because the road ahead may be rough, experts have emphasized that in the face of growing risks, Asia must prioritize [disaster resilience](https://www.adb.org/news/asia-must-prioritize-disaster-resilience-face-growing-risks-adb-study). Doing this entails focus on measures that prevent extreme disasters and reduce risks such as better natural resource management, climate-proofed infrastructure, and better access to credit and insurance. These measures are Herculean, but may be implemented quickly through partnerships that not only share financial investments, but knowledge and expertise as well.

Transitioning to renewable energy while promoting energy efficiency is also a key area for countries to address. Projects on this area underscore the principles of the Paris Agreement signed by 189 countries, which highlight the need for countries to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas emission to decrease global warming. [Multilateral development banks](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/41117/climate-change-finance-joint-mdb-statement-2019-09-23.pdf), ADB included, have been leading the way in this field, and partnerships could further scale up their initiatives.

The need for increased climate finance becomes greater with each passing day. Projections by experts predict more devastating typhoons in the coming years, intense rains and increased flood risks, more frequent and harsher droughts, and rising sea levels enough to endanger populations of low-lying atoll [island nations](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/372696/building-resilience-pacific.pdf). Partnerships can help address these concerns while introducing innovations that can make the marginalized and vulnerable become more resilient. They will not only help save lives, they can also make their future brighter and climate-proofed.
