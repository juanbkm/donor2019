### Strategy 2030 and facilitating friendly open borders  

The Asian Development Bank, as a multinational development organization, has regional cooperation in its DNA. It has provided a fertile ground for Asia-Pacific's vast potential to come through and contribute to the global good.  

Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) paved the way for DMCs to link up and integrate with other countries to tap economies of scale; strengthen supply chains; facilitate the movement of goods, services, technology, and capital; and respond collectively to global events and shocks.  

ADB approaches its RCI agenda through regional approach, which focuses on projects that build transport and energy connectivity between countries as well as improved trade and investment facilitation.  Further, ADB operationalizes RCI through four subregional programs: Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Pacific Islands Forum, and South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC). 

* The CAREC program helps promote regional cooperation in Central Asia in four priority areas: transport, trade facilitation, energy, and trade policy. It is an essential point of intervention for ADB  to help the CAREC partner countries to emerge as a center of trade and commerce because of the rapid economic expansion of the People's Republic of China and Japan to the east, the Russian Federation to the north, and India and Pakistan to the south. It is a partnership of 11 countries (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People's Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  

* Covering 2.6 million square kilometers and a combined population of 326 million, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is a natural economic and tourism area. The GMS countries are Cambodia, Yunnan Province, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. 

* The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program brings together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. SASEC countries share a shared vision of boosting intraregional trade and cooperation in South Asia, while also developing connectivity and business with Southeast Asia. 

* The Pacific Islands Forum bats for a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity. It comprises 18 members: Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. 

ADB's Strategy 2030 in RCI lays down strategic steps to enhance connectivity and competitiveness, promote regional public goods, strengthen cooperation in the finance sector, and strengthen subregional initiatives. ADB’s goals of a more integrated Asia-Pacific through can be achieved through: 

* greater and higher-quality connectivity between economies, 

* expanded global and regional trade and investment opportunities, and 

* increased and diversified regional public goods. 

### Financing Partnerships at Work 

In 2019, ADB approved 50 cofinanced projects in regional cooperation and integration, with a total of $2,738.8 million in cofinancing. The top cofinanciers were JICA with $2,353.72 million contributions, followed by AIIB with $200 million, EBRD with $60 million, OFID with $40 million, and the Government of Australia with $23.9 million.  

The sectors that with highest RCI-related projects were transport, followed by energy, finance, water and urban infrastructure and services, and industry and trade. The top DMCs with most RCI-related projects in 2019 were Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, multi-country or regional, and Georgia. 

Financing partnership facilities has been enriching ADB’s partnerships platforms by allowing strategic, long-term, multi-partner cooperation linking various forms of assistance to specific sector. In 2007, the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility was established to channel additional financing and knowledge resources from development partners in support of ADB's RCI agenda.  

Under this "umbrella" facility,  three funds currently supported by cofinancing partners are operational: the multi-donor Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund (RCIF), and the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund (ICFF), which are both supported by ADB and the Government of Japan; and Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity Fund (ARTCF) established by the Government of the United Kingdom. 

At the project level, the RCIF catalyzed a cumulative total of $58.0 million in cofinancing from other development partners and governments, equivalent to 80% of cumulative contributions to the RCIF.  

Cofinancing was provided through bilateral and multilateral agencies, such as the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, AusAID, the Agence Française de Développement, and the Global Environment Facility, as well as ADB-administered trust funds and special funds such as the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, the Climate Change Fund, the Japan Special Fund, and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. 

### Closing the Gap: 2019 projects   

In 2019, ADB and its cofinancing partners forged projects to advance the three pillars of ADB's Strategy 2030 for regional cooperation and integration. 

To promote greater and higher-quality connectivity, a project in Tajikistan's important economic corridors was approved. [The Tajikistan: Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, and 5 (Obigarm-Nurobod) Road Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52042-001/main#project-pds) is cofinanced by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for $150 million, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for $40 million, and the OPEC Fund for International Development for $40 million. Through this partnership, a 72-kilometer-long road will be constructed through the mountainous terrain in the Obigarm-Nurobod road section of Tajikistan's M41 highway. This road bypasses the hydropower plant (HPP) reservoir, which upon opening in November 2023, will affect some sections of the highway. This bypass road must be operational by the time the HPP opens because no other part of Tajikistan's national highway network can provide for this traffic, and the only alternative route would represent a deviation of about 500 km. The project will run from 2019 to 2024.  

Similarly, in Georgia, the project [North-South Corridor (Kvesheti–Kobi) Road Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51257-001/main#project-pds) was approved in 2019 with cofinancing from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for $60 million. The project, which runs from 2019 to 2026, is expected to improve connectivity and safety along the North-South Corridor through a 23-kilometers climate-resilient two-lane highway between Kvesheti and Kobi.  

To address energy needs, a project in Mongolia, [Sermsang Khushig Khundii Solar Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/52127-001/main#project-pds) with cofinancing from the Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP) for $9.10 million was approved. The project involves the construction, operation, and maintenance of a 15-megawatt (MW) solar power plant in Khushig Valley, which is located 40 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar and 17 kilometers from the new international airport.  

Trade is at the heart of inter-country and regional cooperation. To support the expansion of global and regional trade and investment opportunities, a technical assistance was approved with cofinancing from the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility for $1.5 million.  

The [Supporting the Implementation of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation Initiatives](https://www.adb.org/projects/53117-001/main#project-pds) technical assistance aims to address the needs of the member states and the secretariat of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) to advance RCI among member states in select thematic areas. The project covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and runs from 2019 to 2021. 

In Sri Lanka, the [South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Port Access Elevated Highway Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/50299-001/main#project-pds) was approved with cofinancing from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for 342.73 million and technical assistance from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for $1.25 million The project will construct about 5.3 kilometers of an elevated toll highway with related facilities between the New Kelani Bridge (NKB) and Galle Face in central Colombo. It will provide a direct link to the city center and the port from the Colombo- Katunayake Expressway via the NKB, and then extend the expressway network into the city. The project will improve last-mile connectivity between the country's expressway network and Colombo's international port, provide better logistics services for freight operations, and facilitate regional trade. It will help alleviate traffic congestion in Colombo's densely populated areas. It will run from 2019 - 2025. 

Some hindrances to trade include unstreamlined regulations and various requirements to move goods. To address this, a project in the Maldives, [South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation National Single Window Project](https://www.adb.org/projects/51330-001/main#project-pds) was approved with cofinancing from the High-Level Technology Fund for $0.5 million. The cofinanced technical assistance will contribute to supporting the Government of the Maldives in related capacity development of various stakeholders, including on change management. The project will make use of information and communication technology to improve efficiency in cross-border control procedures by supporting the development of an automated system to share and harmonize data across systems of transnational regulatory agencies. It will also allow traders and other service providers to submit and obtain unified clearance of export and import documentation requirements through a single point of entry. It will run from 2019 - 2023. 

To help increase and diversify the public goods in regional markets, supporting the internationalization of small and medium enterprises is an essential step toward this end. Covering the countries Cambodia India, Thailand, and Viet Nam, the project, [Supporting Internationalization of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Linking India and the Greater Mekong Subregion](https://www.adb.org/projects/53112-001/main#project-pds) was approved with cofinancing from the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility for US$ 3.00 million. 

Running from 2019 to 2021, the knowledge and support technical assistance will help catalyze trade and cross border investment (internationalization) by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is done by establishing partnerships with business accelerators to identify SMEs with the potential to internationalize; and providing these SMEs with a composite package including information on opportunities, industry expertise, mentoring, and guidance on market entry issues to assist their internationalization. The assistance also links business accelerators and financial intermediaries. 

### Strategic Partnerships and the Future 

The transnational threat that the novel coronavirus, or COVID19, has put to fore how critical regional cooperation has become. ADB's Asian Development Outlook puts regional economic growth in developing Asia in a sharp decline in 2020 because of the pandemic. 

This puts all developing Asia's subregions in weak growth this year due to weak global demand. It says in the report that "subregions that are more economically open like East and Southeast Asia, or tourism-dependent like the Pacific, will be hard hit." 

While some amount of cross-border trade and investment activities is seen to slow down, regional cooperation in the areas of health and medical information sharing must be doubled. An [ADB analysis](https://blogs.adb.org/Asia-Pacific-overcome-COVID-19-by-working-together) observes that "COVID-19 reminds us that we are highly interconnected, not just in terms of goods, capital and information but also human interaction, and that disease does not respect national boundaries." 

ADB's partnerships have an enormous opportunity to contribute to Asia's recovery and preparedness. Pandemic-preparedness may be built into cross-border travel mechanisms, as well as more potent information-sharing platforms between countries to help in containment and prevention i.e., detection at the border, contact tracing. DMCs can benefit from ADB's and its donor's support in upgrading information technology platforms and strengthening capacities of national agencies to implement "new normal" procedures in crossing borders in the context of pandemic prevention and response.
