        <h2>Building Strong Partnerships for Shared Progress</h2>
        
        <p>Strong partnerships are at the core of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) <a href="https://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2030-prosperous-inclusive-resilient-sustainable-asia-pacific"> Strategy 2030</a> works to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.</p>

        <p>Through its work with partners, ADB can mobilize additional financial and technical resources for its support for its Developing Member Countries (DMCs). Partnerships can also help improve coordination and reduce fragmentation of the support provided to DMCs. Finally, partnerships can help deliver outcomes that would not have been possible if either the ADB or the partner had operated in isolation.</p>

        <p>The 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a summary of the different types of financing partnerships that supported the ADB’s sovereign operations in 2019 through either project specific cofinancing or through trust funds. The virtual format of the report allows the reader to explore which partners have new or ongoing partnerships with ADB in 2019, which sectors the partnerships focused on, and in which DMCs the projects are being implemented.</p> 

        <p>Equally important, the 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a large number of impact stories that illustrate and explain how partnership initiatives from the earlier years are delivering concrete impacts on the ground, in alignment with Strategy 2030’s seven Operational Priorities.</p>
