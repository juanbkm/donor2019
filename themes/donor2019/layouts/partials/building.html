        <h2>Building Strong Partnerships for Shared Progress</h2>
        
        <p>Through its work with partners, ADB can mobilize additional financial and technical resources for its support for its Developing Member Countries (DMCs). Partnerships can also help improve coordination and reduce fragmentation of the support provided to DMCs. Finally, partnerships can help deliver outcomes that would not have been possible if either the ADB or the partner had operated in isolation.</p>

        <p>The 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a summary of the different types of financing partnerships that supported the ADB’s sovereign operations in 2019, including loan cofinancing; grant cofinancing, for both investment projects and technical assistance (TA); and through Trust Funds. The virtual format of the report allows the reader to explore which partners the ADB initiated new partnership with in 2019, for which type of activities, and in which countries and sectors.</p>

        <p>Equally important, the 2019 ADB Partnership Report provides a large number of impact stories that illustrate and explain how partnership initiatives from the earlier years are delivering concrete impacts on the ground, in alignment with <a href="./strategy-2030/"> Strategy 2030’s seven Operational Priorities</a></p>

        <p>Overall, sovereign cofinancing reached $4.89 billion, contributing to total ADB sovereign operations worth $23.75 billion. That means that every dollar of ADB sovereign financing was accompanied by about 25 cents of cofinancing from partners. In 2019, ADB successfully collaborated with 33 different partners on 148 individual cofinancing operations that supported sovereign operations in 24 DMCs.</p>
