        <p>Through its work with partners, ADB can mobilize additional financial and technical resources for its support for its developing member countries (DMCs). Partnerships can also help improve coordination and reduce fragmentation of the support provided to DMCs. Finally, partnerships can help deliver outcomes that would not have been possible if either the ADB or the partner had operated in isolation.</p>

        <p>The 2019 ADB Partnership Report highlights many exciting and impactful examples of sovereign financing partnerships. They illustrate and explain how sovereign financing partnerships are delivering concrete impacts on the ground, and how they are aligned with Strategy 2030's seven operational priorities. The Report also provides a summary of the different types of financing partnerships that supported the ADB’s sovereign operations in 2019 through either project-specific cofinancing or through trust funds. While the report largely focuses on sovereign financing partnerships, it also has a separate chapter highlighting nonsovereign financing partnerships to give a fuller picture of ADB's cofinancing activities in 2019. The virtual format of the report allows the reader to explore which partners have new or ongoing partnerships with ADB in 2019, which sectors the partnerships focused on, and in which DMCs the projects are being implemented.</p> 

        <p>Due in large measure to financing partnerships, ADB operations reached $33.75 billion in 2019. Cofinancing totaled $11.86 billion, leveraged by $21.89 billion in ADB’s own loans, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. Of these, sovereign cofinancing for both investment projects and technical assistance reached $4.89 billion while nonsovereign cofinancing reached $6.97 billion.</p>

        <p>ADB's sovereign cofinancing commitments of $4.89 billion add to ADB sovereign operations worth $18.86 billion, including technical assistance.  That means that every dollar of ADB sovereign financing was accompanied by about 26 cents of cofinancing from partners. In 2019, ADB successfully collaborated with 33 different partners on 148 individual cofinancing operations that supported sovereign operations in 45 DMCs.</p>

          All figures in the Partnership Report 2019 are based on commitments. As defined by ADB, “commitment” is the financing approved by ADB’s Board of Directors or Management for which the investment agreement has been signed by the borrower, recipient, or the investee company and ADB. It is the amount indicated in the investment agreement that may or may not be equal to the approved amount, depending on the exchange rate at the time of signing.
